    "maintext":"Read the resolution approved by the U.N. Security Council (PDF)  United Nations (CNN) -- Jubilant Libyan rebels in Benghazi erupted with fireworks and gunfire after the U.N. Security Council voted Thursday evening to impose a no-fly zone and permit \"all necessary measures\" to protect civilians. The opposition, with devoted but largely untrained and under-equipped units, has suffered military setbacks this week. It has said such international action was necessary for it to have any chance of thwarting Moammar Gadhafi's imminent assault on the rebel stronghold. \"We're hoping and praying that the United Nations will come up with a very firm and very fast resolution and they will enforce it immediately,\" said Ahmed El-Gallal, a senior opposition coordinator, before the vote. \"We should not arrive too late,\" French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said at the U.N. The resolution was approved with 10 votes, including those of the United States and the United Kingdom. There were no opposing votes on the 15-member council, but China, Russia, Germany, India and Brazil abstained. Germany said it was concerned about a protracted military conflict. U.N. member states can \"take all necessary measures ... to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, including Benghazi, while excluding a foreign occupation force,\" according to the resolution. Moments after the vote, anti-Gadhafi forces in Benghazi broke into cheers, waving flags and chanting. Antiaircraft tracer fire lit up the sky at one rally. It was not immediately clear just how an international military operation and possible strikes against the Libyan military might unfold. The no-fly zone prohibits Libya's air forces from entering certain zones within the country. The United States and NATO partners have contingencies in place to act within hours, according to an administration official familiar with planning. President Barack Obama will insist on a major Arab role in any no-fly zone, the official said. The contingencies include air strikes and cruise missile attacks designed to cripple Libyan air defenses and punish military units leading Gadhafi's push on opposition strongholds in the east, the official said. Obama called British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Nicolas Sarkozy after the vote. The three \"agreed that Libya must immediately comply with all terms of the resolution and that violence against the civilian population of Libya must cease,\" the White House said in a statement. Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim, speaking in Tripoli, told reporters after the vote that the country will safeguard civilians and its territorial integrity. He called on the international community to send a fact-finding mission to the African nation but not lend material support to rebels. A few dozen pro-Gadhafi supporters chanted, \"Down with the U.N.! Down with Britain! Down with the United States!\" The U.S. military does not view a no-fly zone alone as sufficient to stop Gadhafi. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Thursday that establishing a zone would take \"upwards of a week.\" U.S. military officials have said that a no-fly zone would not halt the heavy artillery the regime is using on the ground. Gadhafi's son Saadi told CNN Thursday evening that troops will change their tactics and take up positions around Benghazi Saturday or Sunday and assist people fleeing from the city. The younger Gadhafi said there will be no large-scale assault. Instead police and anti-terrorism units will be sent into the rebel stronghold to disarm the opposition. Unspecified humanitarian groups can help with the exodus of civilians from Benghazi, Saadi Gadhafi said. In a radio address aired on Libyan state TV, Gadhafi criticized residents of Benghazi and called them \"traitors\" for seeking help from outsiders. The Security Council resolution condemns the \"gross and systematic violation of human rights, including arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances, torture and summary executions.\" It details enforcement of an arms embargo against Libya, the freezing of assets and a ban on most flights. \"The United States stands with the Libyan people in support of their universal rights,\" said U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice. The resolution deplores the use of mercenaries by Libyan authorities, expresses concern about the safety of foreign nationals and demands an immediate cease-fire. Kaim said the Gadhafi government supports a cease-fire, but is working out certain details. The Arab League's U.N. ambassador, Yahya Mahmassani, said two Arab countries would take part in a no-fly zone operation, but he was not sure which two. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the Arab League will be critical to the response to Gadhafi, and that he will travel to the region \"to advance our common efforts in this critical hour.\" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the U.N. vote shows the need for Libyan citizens \"to have a more representative government.\" Earlier Thursday, Libyan state TV said Benghazi would soon come under attack. Gadhafi said that his forces would enter the city to rid it of those \"traitors\" and that his forces will search everyone for weapons. He added that his forces gave amnesty to those who gave up their weapons in the city of Ajdabiya. \"We will not allow further bloodshed among Libyans,\" Gadhafi said. \"Search for the traitors, for the fanatics. Show them no mercy. We will look for them behind every wall,\" Gadhafi said. \"This farce cannot go on.\" There were air strikes on Benghazi's airport Thursday, with three blasts hitting the site about 30 kilometers (about 18 miles) outside the city. The opposition has been using the airport to launch its own air strikes, using a handful of jets that rebels have managed to get off the ground, opposition leaders said.  It is not clear that Gadhafi's ground forces are actually within striking range of Benghazi, but they have been fighting their way in that direction for several days.  State TV claimed Thursday that Gadhafi's forces were in control of Ajdabiya, on the road to Benghazi, a claim disputed by opposition leaders. El-Gallal, speaking from eastern Libya, said \"morale is high\" and people do not want to leave strongholds because Gadhafi \"is willing to kill everybody here.\" The government forces have taken control of the eastern and western gates to Ajdabiya and are trying to breach the inside, opposition leaders said. The opposition says it controls the southern entrance. The opposition says it has a handful of jets that are no match with Gadhafi's superior air power and a pair of Russian-made \"Hind\" attack helicopters. Ajdabiya is the last major point between pro-government forces and Benghazi. If it is retaken by pro-Gadhafi forces, it would give access to roads leading to the heart of the opposition's base. In remarks to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, William Burns, the under secretary for political affairs at the State Department, said Gadhafi's forces are only about 160 kilometers outside Benghazi. \"They've made advances, taking full advantage of their overwhelming military superiority in military firepower,\" Burns said. He expressed fear that Gadhafi, now isolated by the world community, could turn to terrorism again. \"I think there is also a very real danger that if Gadhafi is successful on the ground, that you will also face a number of other considerable risks as well: The danger of him returning to terrorism and violent extremism himself, the dangers of the turmoil that he could help create at a critical moment elsewhere in the region,\" Burns told the committee.

U.S. District Court in San Francisco said the parties requested a 90-day stay for the FTC to review and vote on the proposed settlement. The value of the settlement was not disclosed.  FTC and AT&T reached the agreement on Aug. 2.   The FTC in 2014 sued AT&T on the grounds that the No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier failed to inform consumers it would slow the speeds of heavy data users on unlimited plans.  The intense back-and-forth battle between the FTC and the company included dismissal of the case in 2017 on grounds that AT&T was a common carrier and because of this was not subject to FTC jurisdiction.   The case is Federal Trade Commission v AT&T Mobility Llc,  U.S. district court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco division, Case No. 14-cv-04785-EMC.

    "maintext":"3 MIN. DE LECTURA (Reuters) - El Alav\u00e9s continu\u00f3 el s\u00e1bado con su excelente estado de forma en su estadio de Mendizorroza y logr\u00f3 remontar y ganar 2-1 al Valencia, subiendo hasta la cuarta plaza de la Liga espa\u00f1ola e incrementando sus posibilidades de clasificar por vez primera a la Liga de Campeones.  El capit\u00e1n valencianista, Dani Parejo, puso adelant\u00f3 en el marcador a los visitantes por medio de una falta directa en el minuto 14, pero el Alav\u00e9s -\u00fanico equipo del torneo invicto en casa junto al Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid- respondi\u00f3 pronto.  El delantero Borja Bast\u00f3n marc\u00f3 para los finalistas de la Copa de la UEFA de 2001 en el minuto 21, gracias a un bal\u00f3n desviado dentro del \u00e1rea, mientras que el mediocampista Tom\u00e1s Pina puso al cuadro vasco por delante antes del fin de la primera parte, tras un periodo de fuerte presi\u00f3n.  La victoria deja al Alav\u00e9s con 31 puntos en 18 partidos, uno por delante del Real Madrid, que recibir\u00e1 a la Real Sociedad el domingo. Asimismo, es la primera vez que logran tantos puntos en la primera parte del campeonato liguero.  \u201cEl equipo estuvo espectacular. Hay que valorar lo que ha hecho el equipo y llegar a 31 puntos. Es impresionante. Que lo haga el Alav\u00e9s es para poner un monumento a los futbolistas con esta primera vuelta que est\u00e1 haciendo el equipo\u201d, dijo el entrenador del Alav\u00e9s, Abelardo Fern\u00e1ndez, que se hizo cargo del equipo cuando luchaba por la permanencia en la primera divisi\u00f3n hace 13 meses.  \u201cHemos hecho un partidazo ante un grand\u00edsimo rival. Remontarle al Valencia no es f\u00e1cil. El primer tiempo estuvimos sensacional y en el segundo, salvo un remate de Rodrigo, no recuerdo m\u00e1s remates del Valencia. (...) Si el campo estaba mal, lo estaba para los dos. Nosotros no entrenamos en hielo todos los d\u00edas. La victoria es merecida por nuestra parte\u201d, se\u00f1al\u00f3.  El Valencia, que acab\u00f3 cuarto el a\u00f1o pasado, marcha ahora und\u00e9cimo, con 22 puntos, tras la derrota, que aumentar\u00e1 la presi\u00f3n sobre Marcelino, que se enfrent\u00f3 el mes pasado a peticiones de los aficionados para que dimitiera.  \u201cLo que nos ha pasado hoy tiene una explicaci\u00f3n dif\u00edcil y sencilla. Empezamos bien en un campo impracticable y helado en su mitad. A partir de aqu\u00ed ha venido un gol a bal\u00f3n parado como una de sus armas. En dos saques de esquina nos metieron dos goles. El primero y segundo evitables\u201d, afirm\u00f3 Marcelino.

    "maintext":"READ about Piers Morgan's long career in journalism here.  In advance of an upcoming documentary centered around the Penn State scandal, this evening \"Piers Morgan Live\" welcomed John Ziegler for a contentious and combative interview that featured raised voices, and heightened emotions. Insisting that the late Joe Paterno was fired without cause from his post as head football coach of the Nittany Lions, the 45-year-old Ziegler said his film is simply about finding the truth. When Piers Morgan countered by suggesting that Paterno knew about Jerry Sandusky's inappropriate behavior, and even aided in a cover-up, Ziegler resorted to personal insults draped in sarcasm: \"You know nothing about this case. I know you won 'Celebrity Apprentice,' so you must be really smart,\" he bellowed. \"You seem to think this is a commercial endeavor. This is not a commercial endeavor.\" Writing off his guest's insults as simply offensive for the sake of shock value, the host goes on to read a statement from the Paterno family, noting that \"nobody wants you doing this.\"   Suggesting that Ziegler is only serving to put the victims through additional trauma, while also attacking the Paterno family in the process, Morgan inquires about the specific motivation behind the documentary: \"My only agenda here is to find out what happened,\" he stated. \"You guys in the media didn't do a good job of that. You bought into a narrative that makes no sense and for which there is no proof.\" Watch the clip, and listen to the interview, as Morgan and Ziegler engage in a fiery exchange of ideas and opinion, in the process even tossing around a few insults.\n-\n\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Twitter\n\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Instagram Why does Sean Hannity keep begging over this weekend on his weak news forum  that he wants to BOMB IRAN and start another WAR!      His children arent going to be up front ( or even in the military, Id be Gasped)  He seems to whine to the weak minded followers who cant think for theirselves ( great dinner though, Huh?) Shut up and keep your flimmsy mouth SHUT, unless your joining the American Military SEAN!     No more Wars!   Bush didnt pay for the last TWO!      Every other congress ( besides the Sham of govnerment Congress 112th and 113th  that gets paid for nothing)  assessed a tax to pay for previous wars!     Now Somebody give me the total of Trillions calculated from  Iraq and afganastand. Post the entire interview please. Yes, please post the ENTIRE interview please Piers. YES, PLEASE POST THE FULL INTERVIEW \u2013\nBy posting only a portion \u2013 it shows CNN knows Pierce last evening with John Zieglar was a DISASTER Yes post it all \u2013 what a shambolic ramble by Piers \u2013 name calling and shouting over his guest \u2013 this was awful to watch and he was plain wrong to conduct himself like that. Piers, stop acting like you're concerned with the victims, only to turn around and ask\/drag Sherry West onto your show.  Sheesh! How about a little decorum? I don't believe Sherry West's story for a minute.  I feel very sad about her little boy, but her older son was killed while he was attempting to murder someone else.  Her story is full of holes and crocodile tears.  She condemned the mother of those boys, while she herself had raised a son who was going to murder someone.  How convenient that was not mentioned during the interview.  The truth will come out eventually. Piers I am sorely disappointed in your interview with Mr. Ziegler. You apparently are faltering in ratings and just looking to do hatchet jobs on guests you do not agree with, versus truly following in Larry's footsteps and doing a professional interview. Mr. Zeigler is not defending Sandusky at all, he is trying to reach the truth about Joe Paterno, who was used as a scapegoat by the Penn State Board. The rush to judgement is about the rush to find a scapegoat by the board and the media's desire to tear down a person who lived life by the highest morale values and had a greater impact on student athletes that is unmatched in sports. I have supported you in the past, but now am longing for Larry King to return to his show that you are using as a bully pulpit. Piers, do your homework instead of taking the easy route of attacking and talking over your guests. I was pretty upset about the way Piers went about this interview and wanted to post my disgust, but Steve summed it up nicely. What he had in front of him was a mirror. That man treated Piers like Piers treats others and he couldn't handle it. Then he goes to a break, and then goes to a so-called expert who didn't know much, and then cuts off the interview. Was that Piers Morgan or Nancy Grace? I couldn't tell the difference tonight. I've always felt that if you ask someone a question, they should be able to answer. I don't think I'll watch him again. Plenty of channels on my TV. Totally Agree...Steve summed it up perfectly.  I have always supported Piers and DO NOT support Paterno...but that was extremely unprofessional. Totally agree, Piers is a waste of space.  The point of Ziegler's appearance was to discuss the lack of evidence that Paterno covered up anything.  Piers just kept ranting that John was attempting to prove Sandusky was innocent and the Paterno was guilty of a coverup because he was fired by the BoT. I absolutely agree with it..Professionally he is making poor choices.. Piers is not alone in this! Matt Lauer used the same deflecting questions on the today show. I'm sure ESPN (EVIL) will ignore and deflect Mr. Ziegler's story also as they are the leaders of this destruction of a town and a university and a great man's reputation all so the state of Pennsylvania could avoid large civil payouts for bumbling the 1998 investigation! Sad and disgusting. Morgan needs to take a LONG WALK ON A SHORT PIER Steve do you look around your city and scratch your head to how discombobulated everything is in its reality?  forget this tory and look around where you are, cant escape,  better start with the schools PTA and work your way to the State Capital.  reality check! I couldn't agree more. No journalistic integrity here. Pierce I always liked you n\nBut you are a bully an hypocrite ! When people accused you of first hand knowledge of \"news of the world\" shenanigans you denied denied denied! I knew nothing saw nothing how convenient.\nYet you are so quick to judge Joe Paterno, why didn't you do a right thing Pierce???? B Poor interview. Mr Morgan would not let the guest finish his say and then rebut. He never addressed the guests claim that the dismissal is not proof of cover up. It is not. If Mr. Morgan's positions were strong and accurate he would not become so defensive. Let the guest have his say so we can hear his case. It will succeed or fail on its own merit. Poor job overall. Was really disappointed with Piers actions and responses. Piers seemed to be the one ranting and raving. He knew what the guest was going to talk about but yet didn't want to hear anything. Lost a lot of respect for the show. 15 minutes of yelling back and forth. Piers, Educate yourself with the material before your show. Mr. Ziegler was right. I compare Piers Morgan to a Jerry Springer circus act. Why request interviews on these topics and then just taunt them with your feminism manners? John Ziegler had all the facts tonight. Pompous buffoon Pee-ers Morgan was on the ropes, shocked that his total ignorance of the subject matter was revealed so publicly,  (well, to all 15 viewers of \"Piers Morgan Live\"). Morgan was babbling the same sentences, using the argumentative style of Pee Wee Herman .\"I know you want to bring up facts, but what about Sandusky?\" was repeated 17 times by Morgan. Finally Morgan, screaming \"No Mas\" ran to karen Peetz ugly step daughter, Sara Ganim, who won a Pulitzer Prize for plagarism. Piers you were more like a politician than an interviewer tonight.  You avoided addressing everything Ziegler said and made a real mess of it because you had an agenda. I watched the interview and saying you welcomed him was a joke, anytime you don't agree with your guests you attack them and don't let them finish a sentence.  I might not like what your guests have to say sometimes but c'mon man let them talk.  You lost a viewer tonight because I'm sick of watching you attack guests and cut them off.  You are no Larry King! Piers, I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses. I am shocked at your opinionated conjectures that cloud your reasonableness. It makes me wonder how I will be examined for my beliefs when the time comes. (and the time will come.) It started with gun control, which I advocate, but you are embarrassing.  Joe Paterno never had a day in court, yet you condemn him before hearing or allowing a full disclosure of facts. And that is shameful to the public - you censored my obtaining a viewpoint, that I could judge as reasonable. You judged what I would think. Is this China??? You are stupid. Some of us have a better skill in examining viewpoints. Why are you being paid??? Go Home!!!! Please,\nAl Mr. Moirgan really needs to listen to himself.  If the young man, victim 2 ithink Mr. Zigler said really did not verify did not support what was reported to the courts then the coverup is by the FBI, police, and by the prosecution.  That is what uyou should be looking into.  Please get to the bottom or at least see if you can interview victim 2. I was very disappointed in this show\u2013my first and last time to watch. Morgan did not let his guest speak and in fact, seemed like he was on an agenda to shut up Mr. Ziegler. Then, he let's the Mom of the baby who was shot go on and on. No one wanted to hear an account of that tragedy. Shame on you. You are a poor excuse for a host who is obviously scraping for ratings. With his behavior, I turned the show off. I'm done. NEVER watching again. I was actually disgusted with this interview, I really used to enjoy Piers Morgan now he is becoming worse the Olberman and Oreily were and are.  Seems lately he is just not listening to his guests and has an wants to talk down to them.  If the news is too personal to report with objectivity and clarity stay off the topic.  This man had an unpopular view about paterno and was he was turned into a supporter of sandusky which it seemed obvious he was not.  Please change course with this show this was one of the worst but so similar to recent interview Mr. Morgan has done and once again very disappointing.  They may have been a worth while news story here, maybe not but the reality is as the host it was CNNs job to get to that in a polite way and bringing in that reporter who didnt even touch on the paterno topic just further shows how off base the production and direction of this was, just really bad. and this isnt even touching the gun control exploitation and agenda stuff, please fix the show Way to go Steve I agree with you from the post above. John Ziegler stood his ground with Piers. Piers fianlly met someone who could handle his over-powering, bully like, journalist style. Which another word for that style is RUDE. How funny when Piers couldn't handle it he went to break saying John needed to calm down. When the interview continued Piers started twisting the story around and accusing John of false facts. Piers you try to be direct and put your guests in place but it's not working for you. Piers your an embarrasment to all CNN journalists. Go back to Britains Got Talent. If they would even take you back. Piers is an embarrassment.   That was not an interview and very frustrating to watch.  Why have a guest on if you won't let them speak?   Is Piers really so simple he couldn't understand the simple distinction that the point was not to dispute the Sandusky conviction?   Or is it easier to just bully for ratings?   It is obvious he didn't even have a basic understanding of the case beyond headlines.\nCancel this pathetic show and try to raise the intelligence level of your shows. I think Piers was behaving very unprofessional.  He clearly aggravated John Ziegler to the point where he had to insult Piers.  The man didn't want to admit his lack of knowledge yet takes every opportunity to drown out whatever Ziegler is saying.  And the report above is biased (obviously) Piers was saying rude, inaccurate things too.  I'm pretty sure Ziegler wasn't \"shrieking\".  Absolutely silly.  He acts like a little boy in that interview.  Hey Piers, why bring people on your show only to insult them? Filthy Sadly, professionalism is long dead in the ratings-driven world.  Morgan is just another sensationalist that cares little about the facts and knows that these kind of screaming matches tap into the public's endless thirst for crap television. Piers Morgan is so rude to his guests that I will no longer watch him!  He brings on people he knows have a different point of view just to argue with them.  He does not allow them the opportunity to speak and belittles them.  He is a bully!  Please #CNN...remove him from your network. Piers, come on.  Do you really think your opinion matters?  I got sick when I watched some of this show.  I do not see how a journalist can be considered an expert in anything, but their own opinions.  I truly am getting really tired of the television shows that are on TV.  You people commercialize way to much.  You put journalists up on pedestals.\nThose of us who live in the real world see a lot of things wrong and you journalists avoid the real questions and the questions you raise are tainted by opinion.  I am seriously thinking about cancelling my satellite subscription because of the BS I hear on the news and the stupid reality shows taking over.\nWe need a news station that ONLY gives facts that does not cut and paste what they want the public to see and hear  just to boost ratings.  It's all about the money and I think these opinionated journalists called entertainers are totally bloated.\nPeople need to question the validity of someones accomplishments and allow people to explain their opinions without being cutoff by some bloviated journalist. once again Piers proved what an ass he can be, I'm done with his \"show\". I used to be a fan of yours but now am utterly disgusted by you.  Even if you may be correct on the issue, the way that you bully and try to belittle your guests make you look like a fool.  I honestly can't tell anymore if you even do research before debating these issues.  I would much rather hear you rebut with facts rather than spit out responses that do not make any sense and bark like mad dog that doesn't have a bite.  The more I watch you, the more I realize how much of a hypocrite you really are.  How can you say to a guest that they are hurting victims when you are the one you put them on air and gave them the platform to speak to a nation audience?  Anyway, you've lost a fan but here's some words of advice to you... I think that you really have to check yourself before you wreck yourself to the point where you'll eventually lose your show.  It already may be too late though... Piers,\nAmazing job tonight.  Larry King must be shaking his head in shame at what has happened to his interview spot.   Was that your best effort at an interesting dialogue with Mr. Ziegler?   Rather than an intellectually stimulating debate, you pulled off a badgering blubbering aimless attack that was an embarrassment to CNN and journalism.   I can't understand what kind of audience you can generate with your arrogant and unbalanced approach.   Eurekadog pointed out the irony of your sensational anti-intellectual rants - immediately after Ziegler points out that you are the one inflaming the interview with claims that Ziegler was attacking victims, you turn around and splash a grieving mother in front of the nation during the most horrific week of her life.   Your bully pulpit style may play well in Britain.   But the more you attack intelligent people like Ziegler, and any other conservative silly enough to get on your show, you underscore the growing problem with a polarized American media.   You are the mirror image of the Fox journalists you despise so much.   When is CNN going to move away from this sort of demeaning infotainment, and help elevate the level of dialog this country really needs.   CNN - please replace Piers with a real journalist like Fareed Zakaria, Candy Crowley and Erin Burnett.   A talk show doesn't need to be like this. Why does Ziegler feel more compelled to clear Paterno's name than Paterno's own family? Ziegler should just admit that he's exploiting the unconditional Paterno-reverence for financial gain. Sandusky is guilty, Paterno was aware of McQeary's allegations in '98, yet never pursued them. Both got what they deserved. The mcquery allegation was in 2001. The 1998 allegation was investigated by most every law enforcement agency in the area along with psychologists and the attorney general without an indictment. The 2001 allegations reported to paterno were also reported to 2 mandatory reporters of child abuse before paterno was told and another mandatory reporter was told after paterno yet none of the 3 have been charged with a crime that you and everyone condemn and defile paterno for, ironic isn't it? It's a shame you have such limited knowledge of this case.  How could or would Paterno follow up the \"'98 case\" when the DA found no grounds to charge and the case was investigated by CYS and DPW.  Either stop posting nonsense or study the subject. Well, Scott and rothernbj beat me to my point. Your comment is embarrassingly ill-informed about McQuery, Paterno, and the scandal as a whole. So why should we sign on to your conclusions about either of them? Ziegler may be a wired gadfly, but he has researched this more thoroughly than most, and is driven by a hunger for justice for a man he senses has been slandered. This is noble. Everything else about Paterno's legacy is seen as uniquely noble, and the accusation that he protected a pedophile simply doesn't make sense. His MO for protecting his program's reputation over decades was to isolate decadent behaviors and heal or eliminate them\u2013not protect or conceal.  What possible motivation would he have to make an exception for a man he didn't like, whom he told to his face that he should leave the PSU program before the '98 episode even happened, whose access to the football building was arranged in retirement over Paterno's explicit objection, and who was no longer under his authority?  Even if you are cynical about Paterno generally, this \"conspiracy to conceal\" explanation makes no sense. Ziegler has lost more than he has gained for his passion, yet he sticks to it. He is no Penn State alum or fan. He is at least honestly devoted to his cause, and at best, well researched and right. Matt, as they say on jeopardy.....errrrtttt, wrong answer!!!!!!!  Get your facts straight before spewing garbage!!! In reading these comments, it seems that Piers Morgan's bully pulpit \"journalism\" may have helped Zeigler's case.  Zeigler correctly predicted (in advance) that the media would try to spin this as an attempt to exonorate Sandusky.  Piers Morgan is a hack. Matt, study the case a little, your wrong on all counts. McQuery had nothing to do with '98.  That case was investigated and dropped.  Another speaking without knowing.  The '01 case that started the whole connection to PSU football, and the kid involved, who said nothing happened, is the case that got the football program in trouble.  Read and learn the truth before you make as ass of yourself. 1998 is the very weakest point on which to base your assertion, but you would not know that since you never read the original Freeh report and subsequent actual reports. In 1998, the local DA and assorted child welfare agencies investigated and decided there was nothing there. A tragic error yes! But not an error that you could expect Paterno to know about, UNLESS someone broke the law and disclosed a confidential investigation......but no matter, enjoy your bliss, eh? Once again Piers you are making an ass out of yourself. You invite guest onto your show and then talk over them and don't even give them a chance to express their point of view. Why do you do this? If someone doesn't agree with your point of view you get extremely upset and angry. You need to respect the views of your guest and quit being such a jerk before you lose your show altogether. You have done the same thing with all the pro gun guest you have if they don't agree with your point of view. Maybe it's time to think about a career change. The interview was a journalistic disgrace. Mr. Morgan refused to let Mr. Ziegler disclose any facts concerning the media driven narrative of a Penn State cover up. He continuously deflected Mr. Ziegler's attempts to state facts and or opinions which came to light during his interview of Sandusky. Mr. Morgan stated that Joe Paterno was fired, thus proving there was a cover up. Five year olds display better logic than this so called journalist. Mr Morgan wined incessantly about being insulted and offended then proceeded to insult his guest repeatedly towards the end of the interview and then demand complete silence for the Pulitzer Prize Winning Sara Ganim so she could remind us all to remember the victims for the 4 trillionth time like somehow that's going to make everything all better. You know what helps heals victimized people, the TRUTH!!! You know people, it sets you free. Ask Sara Gamin what the TRUTH is? Or ask the Pa attorney general or the states attorney who presented a false Grand Jury presentment or better yet ask the current Pa. Governor what the real truth is? Wake up people, your being lied to everyday by a corporate Facist media in bed with politicians they and other corporations buy through political contributions. I'm a 50 year old husband with two grown children, not a psycho living in a cabin in the woods. I called CNN to express my distaste for them. I ask you to do the same if you care to fight for your right to life liberty and happiness. Fight back before its all gone. Ask questions and demand the TRUTH!! A grand jury presentment that takes 3 years to indict and 7 months to go to trial and convict? 3 mandatory reporters of child abuse who had the same story Paterno Cutley Schultz and Spainier had who did not report it and were not charged? ( 2 medical professionals and a child psychologist???? ) and on and on and on........ I can keep going ............ ????????????? CNN you have a fantastic group of journalists. EXCEPT Piers Morgan. He needs to go. What are you waiting for? We need more hotties like Anderson Cooper. I was so irked by the Piers Morgan show (again) that I decided I had to leave a comment somewhere, hoping that a CNN executive might see it and take note of my plea to remove this individual from the air soon. In my defense, the TV was already set to CNN when I turned it on, so I watched a little bit of the show only by accident. I was very happy to see that, based on the other comments on this site, I am not alone. Having just 87,000 viewers is quite a feat, but having them all hate you is even more impressive. I predict even lower lows in the future for this show. Please replace this person's show by something (anything) else, so I can watch CNN again, as I did before... I usually love watching Piers Morgan, but please Piers would you allow ALL your guests to finish their train of thought without talking over them.  We cannot follow the discussion if you and your guests are shouting over one another..  I know it is frustrating listening to people talk nonsense but we, the audience needs to hear different sides.  If your guest talks nonsense, please allow him to finish his point.  We will then be able to see both views clearly.\nThe gun issue is another topic where you need to stop talking over your guest. Reblogged this on rendrasyahputrablog. Piers need replacing Agree, Piers, you need to find a different line of work. CNN, you can and should find someone a lot better at what this show is about, why do you invite a guest on and don't allow discourse. He's apparently good at phone hacking! Wake up CNN \u2013 this Piers character is ruining your brand! I used to be a die hard CNN fan. It was ALWAYS on! I've now switched to Fox! Piers: You are awful. It's obvious you had an agenda and were not interested in any facts.  That big, wet, sloppy kiss you gave Ganim at the end was embarrassing as well.    You are NOT Larry King. Piers made himself look like an idiot. John had a crucial piece of evidence in his hand that Piers totally ignored, insisting on his personal biased feelings as the \"truth\" instead. It was evident that Piers has not looked at this topic, nor has he educated himself in any way before this interview. To make statements, as if they were truths, without knowing the facts is poor journalism at its worth. Why is this pompous POS still employed??? I would have sincerely liked to have heard what Piers guest had to say.  There is no reason to watch the show if Piers is all I get to hear. And the total lack of manners by Piers was reprehensible.  I will have to research this further, but apparently not on CNN. It was crystal clear that Piers knows zero facts of the Sandusky case and the lack of evidence tying it to Penn State.  That he calls himself a \"journalist\" when he has done no research is a disgrace to the profession.  Maybe he, like Sara Ganim, relied on Twitter feeds for his fact checking! I find it laughable that people are slating Piers. But ignoring the idiot he had in? He makes no sense, he's a rambling idiot. Ignores all facts that are given to him because he doesn't like them \u2013 in fact he is a prime example of the mouth breathers that populate America today. And it's funny that all the people who defend Ziegler are men. Football fans more concerned with a creeps legacy instead of the fact he failed the children in his charge. Keep up the good work Piers. Cracking interview. This entry is on the same level as Piers himself:the guest an idiot, Piers a rambling idiot,bloggers all men, therefore football fans, Paterno a creep who failed children. The pot is calling the kettle black here. Grow up. The children were not in Paterno's charge. The only questionable case he knew about (1998 was declared \"no wrongdoing\" after police investigation) was promptly reported by Paterno to administrators qualified to investigate, something Paterno knew he was not. He did not let go of it until 10 days later, after he was sure the administrators met McQuery directly. No other cases surfaced until 2011. Incidents off campus and children you are not told about are hardly on your charge. Nice Jordan. I see someone actually made an attempt to answer your ridiculous post. I give him credit, but sometimes you just have to call an ass-hat and ass-hat. And that you are. Piers used circular logic in his argument about Paterno.  Paterno had to know because the Board fired him and because the Board fired him he had to know.  Really?  Piers Morgan does NOT KNOW, nor has he ever known, that no children were assaulted on PSU's campus AFTER Paterno was told about that incident.  The trial verdicts confirm that fact.   Piers also doesn't know that the Paterno family's own expert, James Clemente, stated that Paterno had no idea Sandusky was a child molester.  Sara Ganim won a Pulitzer for LOCAL REPORTING - she reported what the police and AG told her about the incident.  She sat through the trial and was unable to identify the clear cases of perjury by witnesses.  One in particular who referenced her column and said that it prompted him to call the police - the problem was that he called the police BEFORE Ganim's column was ever published. Unfortunate that Ziegler was given the opportunity to share hs knowledge and some truth about the investigation or lack there of, only to be countered by another media hack who has no interest in the truth and just wants to rant.  Clearly the rush to judgement was wrong.  And nobody defends Jerry Sanduscky or what he did.  But Joe Paterno's life long behavior would never suggest he placed football above the well being of children.  Joe had the highest graduation rates ov any Div ! program for years, long before they started tracking it.  That did not happen because he placed football first.  God bless John Ziegler for investing the time and energy in discovering the truth.  Shame on Peirs Morgan for being a blithering idiot who cannot follow a string of logic. Morgan comes across little a medieval inquisitor\u2013that dead certainty of his own correctness rendering guests who disagree with him as unworthy of simple respect and good manners. This might be good television but it is most certainly not good journalism. How about a little objectivity instead of all the grandstanding. In no way did Ziegler deserve the treatment he got there today. Pathetic job Piers. Pathetic!!!!!  \"They fired him, he must be guilty\"  are you kidding. Get the hell out of here or go back to judging ridiculous talent shows. I use to defend you, man, I feel stupid. I saw he \"interview\" which was nothing more than a reporter with an agenda. Piers would not let JZ talk at all let alone finish a sentence. Last time I ever watch Piers. I'm noticing some interesting voices posting on here. It seems that Piers Morgan is finally being called out for being the close-minded, fact-ignoring bully he is. Now the important part: what other facts does he ignore? What other falsehoods does he perpetuate? How many reasonable voices are silenced by his ranting, allowing only one viewpoint \u2013 his \u2013 to be heard? Maybe we should bring Jeremy Clarkson over to be interviewed. It would be nice to see Piers used as a punching bag. I do watch the show.  Piers has 2 personalities.  Charming (like Larry) when he sides with a guest.  Boorish when we is opposed to a guests view (unlike Larry).  Piers was fired from the Daily Mirror after running a false story wrongly accusing British soldiers of misdeeds.  Now after making harsh accusations against Paterno, he wants to shout down contrary evidence. He is guilty of being a known slanderer.  By his own logic, he must be.  He was fired for it.  Step by step Piers tried to discredit his guest, not by refuting the guest's evidence and information, but by assailing his character.  \"You are out to make money\".  No.  \"You are out to hurt the victims\".  Uh, no.  \"You think Sandusky is innocent\".  No!  He is already convicted.  But the specific link to Paterno, the story that the media ran with, was wrong. I would have liked to hear what this guy had to say.  Piers did one thing, at least for me.  He made this guy look credible.  And he made himself look like a guy who got the story wrong, and will childishly defend his position when confronted with facts. Piers looked like he was performing in an absurd Monty Python skit. Piers owes this dude an apology.  He is too small to apologize. Bad interview Piers. If you don't know a lot on a topic, do less of the talking and add supplementals to the interview \u2013 not try to talk over and belittle your guests. And Paterno was the fall-guy, the media and the country needed a high profile person to blame and he was the biggest fish to fry...pathetic. Piers, I just watched your attempted interview with the jerk named Ziegler, regarding Sandusky, PSU and Paterno.  Regardless of any \"evidence\" he claimed to had,  the jerk showed total disrespect for You and Sara.   His incredible lack of respect totally discredited anything he may have been trying to say.  I'm not sure he is intelligent enough to realize that, based on his behavior.  I admire you for keeping your composure and not just coming across the table and slapping the \"totally disrespectful\" jerk. Thanks for what you do.\nSteve Libsack Hogwash.  Piers Morgan is the one who should apologize.  He also needs to go back to journalism school while he's at it. lol. What interview were you watching where Piers 'kept his composure'. You appear to be on an island.  Judging from the comments I have been reading above, the overwhelming majority of posts support the opinion that Piers acted like a complete a- H-!.  He had NO FACTS, and rather than find out whether his guest had anything of value to report, he instead decided to attack the guest.  Unfortunately Piers has no real understanding of the facts... That become obvious.  I look forward to the time when CNN gets rid of this idiot.  I used to watch Larry King, When I see Piers... I immediately change the channel. How exactly would one have evaluated the evidence? Ziegler never had a chance to explain anything from the start. All we got was a parrot named Piers asserting Fired=Guilty. Just saw a bit of last nights interview this morning. Terrible way to start my day seeing Piers act like an ________.  On this blog it states REPORT ABUSE.  Piers Morgan is an abusive journalist. Terrible, awful, disgusting, embarrassing, fowl, unkind, rude, unprofessional, apalling, sickening, disheartening, rude, nasty. More evidence that Piers Morgan's show is a joke, and he's a pathetic telejournalist CNN needs ratings, I guess. They're evidently not so much interested in quality in this time slot.  I used to watch Piers, and I saw these behaviors from him over and over.  In short, he's much more offensive than anyone on FOX.  If CNN were interested in quality, they would certainly end their association with Piers.  He adds nothing and only takes away from their network. Piers, you made yourself look like a buffoon. You had none of your \"facts\" correct. Horrible performance by you. Question JT,  What have you done for your community lately besides complain about a tradgety all the way around ( story sounds fishy) that is a cancer to your town , city, county?    Stand up  Dude!   get out of the basement1 Piers, you are a clown! this can a job is not for some one like you. what a joke of an interview by piers morgan...Zeigler was making very good points yet Piers would not even let him speak.  This is typical of the mainstream media.  They have a narrative and a viewpoint and they refuse to have a discussion about it because they need to be RIGHT all the time.   Paterno may have made mistakes but all in all he was a good man he was not able to defend himself. Ziegler 100, Piers 0 Piers looked like the ranting idiot here.  I'm sure he only invited Zeigler on to try to make him crack, but Zeigler didn't and Piers' ridiculousness only helped make Zeigler's point that the media was out of control. I thought Zeigler made some very interesting points on The Today Show, really showing a different perspective (not from Sandusky's POV but from Paterno's). I was hoping to hear more of that but Piers' idiot act prevented that. I don't think this completely absolves Paterno yet but alot of what John said on CBS could if proven, such as the shower victim claiming nothing happened. Piers missed a huge opportunity by trying to be a bully. So you saying that the guy who was in the news and told the world he saw the whole thing and later speak to Paterno about it andPpaterno didn't do a dam about? so this guy is lying? hellloooooo! he was telling the true matter of fact he was the one who open the pandora box! It was obvious Piers had little to no knowledge of the Sandusky story. He could have been educated by Ziegler if he took the time to let him talk and asked him relevent questions. Instead, Piers attacked Ziegler and railroaded the interview. What a sad excuse for a journalist or interviewer. In what could have been a great informative interview for Piers which would have garnered national attention, it turned into a Jerry Springer segment because Piers didnt want to hear he was wrong. I am surprised CNN keeps Piers Morgan on the air. He lacks journalistic integrity and doesn't truly engage in any type of meaningful debate or discussion. Its all about Piers! Piers is ALWAYS right and everyone else is ALWAYS wrong. When a guest starts to get the better of Piers, he just cuts them off, tells them they're disgusting or goes to break! What a phoney hypocritical little schoolgirl! Piers, In addition to your appalling manners toward your guest, Mr. Ziegler, I'm afraid you were terribly unprepared and uninformed on the subject matter.  There really is no evidence at all that Joe Paterno is guilty of anything.  None.  That is the story waiting to be told.  I should think a true journalist would be very interested indeed in hearing what Mr. Ziegler had to say..... So true. Piers is a coward. Right or wrong, he couldn't justify anything he was trying to say. Ziegler had \"facts\" that he could back up \"alledgely\". Piers was way out of his league and resorted to name calling. Not all that long ago Piers was \"owned\" not only by Ben Shapiro, but also Jesse Ventura, Larry Pratt, Joshua Boston, Sheriff David Clarke, Ted Nugent and Dana Loesch, to name but a few. In just about each instance, Piers lost his cool once he realized his guests were getting the better of him and exposing Piers' true lack of knowledge on most issues. He goes into a hissy fit, tossing papers about, turning beet red, calling his guests names and then generally, says he doesn't want to hear anymore or see them on his show.  What type of unbiased discussions are these? They're not! Piers is very biased towards the left! His opinions are always right! CNN...its high time to get rid of this hack! I'd rather see Cosmo Kramer anchor the show! He's smarter! I lived in PA for awhile so I've followed the whole Sandusky case fairly closely. Piers got so many things wrong I don't know how he still has a job. Good for Ziegler to lay the smackdown on Piers, he deserved it. I would have really liked to have heard what John Ziegler had to say and the evidence about the supposed victim 2 in which apparently nothing happened on the night in the Penn State locker room.  That entire night is the reason Penn State and Joe Paterno have been vilified in the media.  Shame on you Mr. Morgan. I would make bet that Piers Morgan will beat down doors to get Jim Carrey as a guest on his tabloid show,because of Carrey's ridiculous anti gun propaganda video...just sayin From day one, after he had taken over for Larry King, as an interviewer\/journalist, Piers Morgan has shown himself to be an arrogant, pompous ass.  I seldom watch Morgan, but when I do it's,only for a short period of time simply because he is unbearable to listen to. His previous success was, if you call it that, was from the graciousness of Simon Cowell, who put him on a show as a judge of talent. Prior to that show he had an uninspiring career. Why would anyone think he would do a formidable job on American T.V.? I agree with many observers of his show, that it should be closed down, and that he should be shipped back to England I totally agree ..Morgan has a career history in tabloid journalism  which is pocked marked with scandal and corruption...Morgan was once fired from the Daily Mirror for faking photo's to make it appear that British soldiers were abusing prisoners..and Morgan was actually escorted from the building...His rants on gun control is not based in the facts and he is openly rude to any guests who opposes him...Morgan will think nothing of using Newtown and the families of the Sandy Hook tragedy as propaganda props for his liberal anti gun agenda because Morgan is more concerned in boosting his low ratings then in reporting the truth. Why would anyone agree to be a guest on this show? Piers never gave Ziegler a chance to speak, and I would have liked to hear his viewpoint. Piers continued to show how little he knew each time he said the PSU a) fired Joe Paterno b) because he knew Sandusky was a pedophile. Paterno was relieved of his coaching duties due to the media circus\u2013his presence would be a distraction on the field. Paterno also was commended for in his Grand Jury testimony for reporting appropriately.\nBringing Sara Ganim into the interview was totally unecessary. All she could do was immaturely roll her eyes.\nAnd then compounded her immaturity by tweeting Morgan about how much fun it was afterwards.\nI've totally lost all respect for CNN. As someone not knowing the background of the case I was interested to learn from the debate between two mature people. I was sorely disappointed as the two obvious adversities shouted each other down. Mr. Ziegler obviously had a point to make and I wanted to hear what that was. Unfortunately Mr. Morgan did not and his control of the 'interview' was non-existent. It was embarrassing and detrimental to the standing of CNN and in my opinion Mr. Morgan loses impetus in his excellent stance on the Gun Debate. I will of course exercise my right to not tune in to anymore of these segments but feel cheated by the loss of what could have been an unbiased program. Michael,\nPlease go to the framing paterno.com site if you would like to read a comprehensive report of John Zeigler's work.  You will learn considerably more doing so in comparison to watching Piers Morgan act the fool. Piers Morgan proved how little he knows about this case last night. John Zeigler has been studing this case for the last 16 months and he knows way more about this then Piers. It's funny that the only \"evidence\" that Piers could provide that \"proves\" that there was a cover up was the fact that the PSU Board of Trustees fired Joe Paterno. The main stream media should be absolutly ashamed with the way this story was covered. The media had an agenda and they refuse to give a voice to someone like John Zeigler who has an opposing view. The \"cover up\" theory doesn't even pass the laugh test. The media agenda was to attack and destroy Paterno's legacy and they succeded tremendously. If you believe, without a ounce of proof, that Paterno and the rest of the administrators at PSU knowing covered for a child rapist for 15 years than you are a complete moron. this was no interview.  Piers Morgan was a jerk.  His style reminded so-much of Sean Hannity.  Maybe Morgan should go to Fox.  He'd fit in fine there. What a terrible display by Morgan. He does need to be replaced. I was dying to hear a few words from Ziegler and he wouldn't let him get a word in edgewise. I won't be watching this trash anymore. I wonder if Piers was a victim or an abuser in his past. He sure gave up all of his professional training (if he ever had any) to make sure Ziegler didn't get to say anything. His \"open mind\" as a reporter sure went bye bye for this botched interview. I agree that Paterno could have done more, probably would have if it would have been his son\/grandson that got victimized. Extremely disappointed at the \"FOX LIKE\" style of Morgan. I can only hope that this is somehow a desperate test to see if \"outfoxing FOX\" can improve your ratings. Those of us who are long time loyal CNN viewers now have nowhere to go but PBS.  Even a test pattern would be better than this show. The viewing public deserves better. Interesting that CNN didn't post the entire interview. Why not??  CNN was crazy to hire Sarah Ganin. She is her own biggest fan. Check out the facts of her PP. HEY CNN and PIERS MORGAN! Are you people reading this stuff? Time for change! Send the arrogant Brit back home to England where hopefully he can try to do some good for the most violent country in the EU and that's with a total gun ban. How's that workin' for ya Piers? You NEVER speak about those facts do you? You tell half truths and only if they suit you! You are upset with Morgan is because he is bringing the subject about Patterno's guilt and he was guilty ,and I hope he rots in hell  you hate Brits is all ! I dislike him too but this time he is right!and I am glad he got this moron Ziegler who I don't know who  the heck he is anyway and let he rant like a sycho! PIERS MORGAN ~ both judge and jury...and always right! Bollocks! Out of the 105 comments here, less than a handful are pro-Piers, like Piers or agree with his style and content! CNN...that must say something to you! I am at least happy on this blog, that it is so far, not pre-screened! CNN, on Twitter, just blocks folks and reports people as spam for either too many mentions or comments with which it doesn't agree. By allowing this blog to remain \"open\", CNN and readers here will get a genuine feel for what people really think. Censorship sucks and always has a hidden agenda! Piers' basic thesis is that if you are fired, you are guilty.....thank god the Anglo-Saxon court system does not work that way! The Penn State Board basically panicked when the ambulance chasing media went wild (Piers, have a mirror handy?) Piers is very unprofessional. He does not need to be deported, but CNN needs to replace him at this core prime time slot. I have also stopped watching his program. Ziegler probably paid by the Paterno family to make Joe into Saint Joe. Joe was a GOD on the campus and in State College but he chose to protect the BRAND as did all the others. For this they are not to be praised but demonized as they continued on their merry way while the BEAST feasted. How can anyone have sympathy for these spineless snakes. Well, another person who doesn't have a clue what he\/she is talking about. shaker47 you do not have a clue about this situation. Unfortunately, JCA, this is obviously another person who is eating just what the mainstream media is feeding them.  This whole story has taught me to be very selective on what I believe.  I have found that on almost anything I might have an opinion on, requires me to do extensive further research, before forming that opinion, rather than relying on what the talking heads are saying.  They have SO many things wrong in regards to this case and unfortunately, John Zeigler couldn't keep his cool enough to present a portion of what I'm talking about.  I think both behaved badly.  It was painfully frustrating to watch.  I would like more of the national news people to step up, like Bob Costas did, and admit that they might have voiced their opinions without knowing everything they should before spouting.  I have enormous respect for that.  Piers, on the other hand, just seemed VERY ill prepared for this interview and didn't bother to inform himself prior.  The logic of \"fired by the Board of Trustees=guilty of cover up\" is naive, at best, and ignorant and closed minded at worst.  I DID watch his show pretty regularly, but no more.  Makes me sad because CNN was my go-to channel for news.  (For the record, I find it deplorable that John Zeigler would give this animal the opportunity to be back in the headlines and have his voice heard.  Has bothered me a great deal.  But now I've decided that must be the only way that the media would pay attention to what he had to say....missed opportunity here). This interview was an absolute disgrace.  Zeigler is not trying to say Sandusky is innocent...he is trying to show that Paterno was railroaded and scapegoated by both the PSU BOT and a mainstream media that went for the storyline that would generate the most sensationalism and therefore lead to higher ratings, more papers sold, more web hits and in the end more advertising $$$.  I encourage anybody interested in Zeigler's work that could not make out anything he tried to say last night because of Piers' unprofessional demeanor to go to framingpaterno.com.  Very eye-opening... Piers if you want to be a real journalist, you should do some research on this subject.  You are in a position to bring to light some of the true injustices in this case.  Do the right thing, and do your research.  Yes we all need to think about the victims, but one of those victims is Joe Paterno.  The man dedicated his whole life to just causes.  He was wrongfully condemed by people like you.  I challenge you, just research it.  CNN should remove you from the air. Joe should have and could have got involved in something as horriffic as this. This should not have been flipped to the side and ignored but it was and all the heavy weights on that campus and in the town, that knew about it, should have been concerned. They had an opportunity to do good but they chose to protect the money making machine. That makes them guilty as hell and they deserve to punished severly. They could have hired a PI to follow the monster sandusky around but when you main concern is money, trophies and more money you protect even a satanic brand. Really scott!   just like 99% of the cry babies that bothered to reply instead of give a serious discussion on the fall of Western civilisilation.   Not any effort of where did we go wrong to have this story and the freakin massacres all year long.   Can anyone stand up and suggest reality to the problem,   Next! If you people  dont  realize this decay of every city and community is in full forse to desimate tomorrows future, then bend over and kiss your on BUTT!      Be weak minde! Think you hit the nail on the head.My knowledge of this case is tacit,but I DID hear of it on ABC News which is shown in UK;we've had scandals like this and it gets very murky and convoluted;your point on where we're headed is a pertinent one,pandemically,but particularly for you:as we speak,gun factories are on 24-hour production just to deal with backlogs they are CHURNING them out,Black Market set to be deluged,that little boy asleep in his stroller,I don't know where it's\nall gonna end,but we could be sailing off the edge... Piers,\nYou come off like a bumbling idiot in this piece. You clearly have no legitimate knowledge of this case. Maybe you should read the Freeh report, then read the Paterno report before you comment on the case. What many of you in the main stream media seem to forget is that; DPW failed to catch Sandusky, Child Youth Services failed to catch Sandusky, PA State Police, numberous child Psychologist, PSU police, Second Mile Execs...the list goes on and on. Countless people had WAY more knowledge of Sandusky than Paterno. They did nothing. Why? Do so reading and educate yourself before you bash Ziegler. You interviewing him hurts the victims a lot more than he does. You did an awful job. Hope you got the ratings you needed. All this interview served to prove is that no one wants to talk about what happened. Even Paterno's family doesn't want to talk about, for fear even more damage will be been done... The issue that should have been discussed is that Paterno did not receive due process, and he's been blamed pretty much for anything and everything that happened. And the rather clumsy action of the NCAA, to delete Paterno and Penn State's entire record, as well as their championships, is a full blown and comical whitewash job. As for Morgan's interview, he was shrill, pigheaded, and showed he's capable of the most extraordinary stupidity. What could have been an interesting interview turned into a train wreck, thanks to Morgan. And Piers thought he was insulted over the Celebrity Apprentice comment? Well, Piers seems to be ready to run from any part of his part these days. The point of this interview was to present FBI evidence that the alleged \"shower incident\" that brought down Paterno and the entire University at Penn State NEVER HAPPENED.  So why in the hell did Piers Morgan turn it into a Sandusky show?  Ratings.  This was a disgusting interview.  Piers Morgan should be fired.  Bring back Larry King or another real professional who believes that true journalism is about uncovering the truth, not SENSATIONALISM!! Why would anyone care what a foreign criminal tabloid gossip columnist thinks of serious issues? Being Donald Trump's butt-boy for a month on a scripted \"reality\" show\" hardly proves one's intelligence. And having the lowest rated show on a flailing \"Airport Waiting Area\" network is not the pinnacle of journalistic success. If Zeigler wants to get the message out, he should do it during year-old reruns of \"Jersey Shore\". That show gets 40 TIMES the ratings and viewers as Peirs. It's pretty bad when you have to drag Sara Ganim into the show for \"gravitas\". Why do people watch this Pierce guy?  He seems to be clueless about the topics he \"reports\" on and is extremely biased in his opinions.  Is he even an American citizen? Wow, Mr. Morgan.  You are a rude, overbearing blowhard.  LISTEN sometimes.  Won't waste my time watching you screech at people again. It would be nice ,if when you do an interview, you actually allowed the person to talk. Just because Mr. Zieglar doesn't share your point of view on the Penn State matter, is not a good reason to shout him down. Here in America, we like to hear other peoples ideas(at least I like to think most of us do). If you continue to treat your guests the way you have been,  I for one will not be watching. I can't believe is a bunch of morons in this site talking about Paterno not have nothing to do with the whole thing of  the guy molesting the children  he was a complice when you know the crime and you keep shut ,you are part of the crime ,he was part of the crime and I hope he is rotten in hell,he put his career and the football team up over the crime of molesting and raping children,he is guilty as the rapist! if he had the decency of speak  up in behalf of the victims ,many children will not go thru what they went ,this morons who don't accept this guys guiltiness are beyond the sports matter ,for them sports are over a child safety and is wrong and SAD!  I personally dislike Piers Morgan I dislike him a lot ,but that not have nothing to do against Paterno, he is a Tv journalist that I dislike him indeed! and by the way John Ziegler who? that Piers didn't won the Aprentice? you don't have to be smart if Arcenio won (he is not that smart) is luck just because he  recruit  more money for his charity that is not being smart at all! Ziegler is a moron like the morons here  who are upset about Paterno, once again I hope he rotts in hell! Maria,  Have you bothered to educate yourself on the subject other that what you hear the mainstream media saying?  If you have, I don't see how you can come to the conclusions that you obviously have.  Read the Freeh report, then read the Paterno report.  It might not make you see things differently, but at least then you can make some educated observations and comments. It's about time someone exposed the media for what it is. Piers Morgan is hardly a journalist. He's a glorified Jerry Springer who took over for Larry King. He is a poor replacement and has no business being on CNN. What's next Ryan Seacrest conducting interviews with world leaders? test? I like Piers Morgan, esp. over that kiss-behind Larry King who would smile and kiss Charles Manson. I thought you were dead along with the Beaver, Wally, Lumpy, June and What's his name. I like Morgan too but he does have a tendency to not allow people to finish speaking. Not like Larry but like Bill O'Riley. I don't care for people that insist on BUTTING in even though they agree with my way of thinking. My philosophy is listen and learn. After watching this interview (WOW what a joke) I've come to the conclusion Nancy NoGrace and Prissy Morgan are the same person lol.I stopped watching cnn and all the other network sensationalism journalist over a year ago.I got rid of my cable and started going to the AP site and\/or Pbs this way if i want to know something i don't need to depend on a bunch of ignorant journalist opinion who are about as smart as a box of rocks(putting my money on the box of rocks to be smarter)\nIs this the kinda crap people watch on T.V.?this was hands down and by far one of the worst shows i have ever seen. (thats saying something considering all the \"B\" rate sci-fi movies I have seen lol) Piers Morgan needs to be taken off the air or hired as a replacement for Jerry Springer if he has a need to entertain.  I feel he is a disgrace to honest journalism and a detriment to CNN.  He was undoubtedly unprepared for the Ziegler interview and was obviously afraid to hear Ziegler's point of view because he had no intelligent or informed response.  I will not watch this show as long as Piers is on it.  Do the viewers and the network a favor ... hire someone who is intelligent and knows how to interview. Pretty weak interview tactics, Piers. The point is to hear what your guest has to say. By screaming about how \"he must have known\" proves nothing; you are merely committing hindsight bias. Piers Morgan had no idea why John Ziegler was even there.  He turned it into an interview on Sandusky when it was an interview on Joe Paterno who never had a chance to speak after he was vilified by the media.  Morgan is a bully and thinks he is a real \"tough\" guy not even giving Ziegler a chance to state the REASON for the interview.  Do some reading Morgan and KNOW what the subject is about before scheduling someone to appear on your show.  You looked like exactly what you are \u2013 a stupid, uninformed ass. Mr Morgan, you are a stupid egotistical bitter old man.  CNN--wake up!!!!!!!!  Here is the proof that you were all wrong, and your network  could be the FIRST to report the TRUTH for a change. Most everyone else has already covered how Piers was clueless, so no need to cover that.  But what I don't understand about all these \"do gooders\", especially Sarah Ganim, how do you learn as a society to protect our kids if we don't know what really happened, the real truth?  Sticking our heads in the sand is going to allow us to protect our children better?  That has really worked in those states where the schools can't teach birth control.  Once the truth comes out and if Joe is culpable, then he deserves to burn in hell.  But everything points to him being duped like the rest of the community.  So why is everyone OK with him and PSU getting punished when it appears they are likely innocent.  Piers, you are a disgrace as a journalist. The best line \"Because the BOT fired Joe Paterno, he is guilty of covering up for Sandusky\"  What a moron.  I guess he has never heard of a BOT of a company or university having arterial motives.  Disgraceful. Usually I don't read post on blogs, however I wish to say that this write-up very pressured me to try and do so! Your writing taste has been surprised me. Thanks, very great post. John Ziegler is a dummy! Joe Paterno was no leader in fact he was a coward.Piers you handle this interview very well. I will not watch this, I can only hope that everyone else does the same.

    "maintext":"READ about Piers Morgan's long career in journalism here.  On the heels of a horrific shooting in Oklahoma which left a promising young baseball player dead and his home country of Australia in mourning, on Tuesday evening \"Piers Morgan Live\" invited a collection of guests tasked with making sense of an incident that has once again put America's gun culture in the spotlight. According to police, 23-year-old Christopher Lane was jogging along the road when three teenagers shot him in the back, allegedly out of boredom. Speaking with Piers Morgan from Melbourne, Ahron Young conveyed the emotional impact that the Oklahoma murder is having 9,000 miles away:  \"We've all heard about gun violence in America, but this has really brought it home to us here. Right across the country parents in Australia who may have children on scholarships in the U.S. and also the students themselves, just out of disbelief that this could happen to one of ours,\" said the Sky News Melbourne Bureau Chief, of Lane, who was attending East Central University on a baseball scholarship.  \"People from the local baseball club have all been down there [Essen] this week. It's been terribly sad, they've been placing a baseball with tributes written on it, flowers on the home base there. His mother and father, they held back tears. They described Chris as just another normal kid. He loved his baseball he's loved the game since he was 15 years old and he loved it because he wanted to go to college in the U.S.\" Nearly two decades ago, Tim Fischer championed Australia's gun control reforms, an effort that has virtually eliminated firearm crimes in the country. Joining \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Tuesday, the former Deputy Prime Minister held little back when voicing his disgust for the alternate approach being followed in America:   \"Just for the record, Australia has had zero gun massacres since 1996, and in the United States, 80 people are killed by guns every single day,\" he noted.  \"So, it is another example of murder and mayhem on Main Street. Yes, people are thinking of going to the USA on business, vacation, trips, should think carefully about it given the statistical facts you are 15 times more likely to be shot dead in the USA than in Australia per capita per million people.\" With ire dripping on every word, Fischer appealed to American authorities to follow in the footsteps his nation imprinted in the late 1990s: \"We don't have gun shows where you can walk up and not even be subject to a background check in one of the most dumbest decisions so far in the litany of agony over the gun laws and gun policies of the NRA and the USA. There is deep seated anger this time and I can tell you there is disbelief,\" said Fischer. \"I just want to say that it would appeal to the deep thinkers in the USA to think again about the drift in the state of the nation.\" Watch the clip for more of Morgan's interviews with Young and Fischer, and for the next edition of \"Piers Morgan Live,\" watch CNN every night at 9.\n-\n\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Twitter\n\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Instagram James ganddfin tony soprano as mob boss 86 episodes bijjing band knife sales after two killing sprees 2 men killed metro vancouver knife attacked. Wake up it not the tools its the people we could band them i guess. Lol If you could write an English sentence, you might make a logical argument. But since you cannot seem to do that, please be quiet until you can take some lessons. Colin, you apparently were able to understand what he said, so why are you criticizing his comments?  Get a life, d-bag. You make a great case against home schooling.  Why not take a nap and leave the discussion boards to the adults? I have a 29 year old niece who was home-schooled since the 2nd grade.  Today she has a PhD in astrophysics, and is an assistant professor at the University of ***************.      She hopes to be granted tenure in a few more years. While she is undoubtedly an exceptional example (in my opinion!), everyone who is home-schooled is NOT a dummy! Dear traveler, you obviously know nothing about  home schooling.  I think you might be ignorant, stupid, or both.  Best you pull over, and sign up for more school.  Preferably home schooling, since you apparently learned nothing the first time around. Did you make it all the way through third grade, Max, or did you have to drop out mid-year? I am a Duncan ok native and my children attend school with these thugs. These boys are not the norm in our community but I am not shocked to learn that these boys are responsible.My son also a sophmore has always been terrified of AKA\"Bug\" James Edwards. There have been gun threats made at school for tomorrow and the teachers web page is stating if parents hold their children out of school it will be an excused.Our small community has been rocked by this sickening tragedy. Our hearts go out to Sarah Harper and Chris's family and friends. If these three thugs were known troublemakers with guns, why wasn't something done about them? why didn't the police question them about gun possession and violence? The community is not at fault and I sympathize....but we all have to take responsibility when something like this happens and try and prevent it from happening again...the advice \"if you see something say something\" applies to more than just terrorists. The problem is that WE as a society always want to make an excuse, they are too young, they are misguided, etc. It may apply to some but in this case if these kids are KNOWN to be troublemakers then they need pay the piper. There should be no leniency because they are teenagers and the parents need to be looked into because most likely they had to get this behavior from somewhere or someone just didn't teach them that life has value. Simple and Plain. I am black and lived in the \"hood\" but one thing my kids respect is life and not to hurt people unless they are being harmed. Good comment Unfortunately Danny,it isn't only the excuses made. And, I'm pretty sure you are aware of that. I do totally respect you guiding your children to a life of respect and abiding by the law, don't misunderstand that for a moment. The problem is, there are too many black fathers that don't make that effort. In failing to do so, they leave their children to grow up with gangsters and drug dealers as role models, and this exact situation is what happens when they do.  This problem is much deeper than society as a whole Danny, the problem is deeply rooted in current black society and black culture. It's in the actions of the 76% of black fathers that fail to make a home with their children, and teach them right from wrong as you are. It's in the music produced by blacks for blacks, that glamourizes the gangster lifestyle in question. It's in the hood every day. Until black society gets fed up with the current black culture, starts demanding respect be taught the children, and takes a stand against those that refuse to respect the law, and others, in the hood, this problem is going to continue, and unfortunately respectable Black Americans, such as yourself, that are trying to do right by your children, are going to be caught up in the mess that others in your society are creating. You already are in fact.  White people have been very tolerant of black on white crime, the liberal media has been playing it down, and playing it down, and playing it down, to the point that they simply don't report on it. But Barack Obama, and Jesse Jackson, and Al Sharpton, and the Media all ran around for MONTHS pointing fingers at White People, when a Hispanic defended himself against the attack of a black teenager. Then crap like this goes down every day and white folks are getting REAL FED UP with this sort of thing Danny. White folks are fixing to start demanding accountability, if the black community is lucky. If they're not, there's going to be a war unlike anything you want to see. And, while there are a few brothers that are dumb enough to believe they're going to win such a war, the odds aren't in the black community's favor. This country is getting more barbaric by the day. They need to execute these three pieces of excrement, and they need to punish the parents and school authorities, as well. There are adults out there who enabled this. Its sad this happens  everyday.  Ask your pres why do we cross the street when we see 3 black youths ??? We does everyone lock their car doors when we see 3 black youths ???  no this isn't racism its self preservation Mr Pres !!!!\nI think its answered why we cross and lock. We are trying to stay alive Would you cross the street if you saw Dimaggio the guys who burned that girls family alive?or what about the two white guys who walked into elementary schools with assault riffles to kill innocent children? 3 blacks? please, please take a look or read about the 3 suspects... 1 black, 1 bi-racial and 1 caucasian. Therefore it is not just \"3 blacks\". The 1 caucasian is the youth who confessed to the police that THEY decided they were bored and that THEY will kill someone. Funny how it was a group effort and only 2 are being charged with first degree murder. Lane deserves complete justice... one for all, all for one!! Punish them all... do not lessen the charge for a confession. It is more than obvious that all 3 youths were involved in the horrific crime. @ b I did read there were 3 black kids and one white-Hispanic, point being the largest majority of crimes are from black youth.  Why don't Obam, Sharpton, Jessie march in those neighborhoods and help these people better themselves??\nits clear they don't want to help, they just want media time which leads to donations.  If they spent time there showing, teaching & educating young men it could only help society,  whether black or white,  the point being Americas youth is off the chain due to everyone trying to be P. correct !! The best place to start would be teaching how to respect women. I live in Texas and have a concealed-carry permit for a good reason.  Our primary threat is from hordes of fearful, bigoted red-necks driving around with Confederate flags and hate bumper stickers.  As a white man in an affluent neighborhood I face few risks from the crime associated with poverty.  However, the conspiracy-fueled, hate-inspired, ignorance-based racists in our community are anxious to \"stand their ground\" \u2013 as dreamed about in some right-wing fantasy.  I pretty certain you understand how they feel... Its feral low lifes from a debased sub culture not actual Americans.  I am so very sorry. I have been watching Piers Morgan for the last two years attempt to have a reasoned debate with his guests about the need for gun law restrictions in the U.S.  Its time to recognize the sad truth that America has become a gun crazed society.  There is a pervasive fascination with guns that has something like a religious fervor to it.  If you're not extolling the \"virtue\" of owning guns while citing the second amendment as an almost godlike authority, then you're living your life scared of being a victim of the next random violent act with a gun by a fellow citizen who  happens to have some chip on his shoulder.  The point is that America's fascination with \"the right to bear arms\" no matter what the cost both to innocent life and liberty to live safely in one's community is now in its essence a pervasive social disease. All the intellectual arguments in the world do not address the fact that this is a fundamentally emotional not a rational debate. That is why the debate never goes anywhere\u2013 a stalemate that continues for the benefit of the gun lobby and will continue to do so for as long as so many Americans keep guns central to who they are or are just too afraid not to own one because they fear for their own safety.  There is at the core of the problem the belief that there are no good collective solutions to problems and it is up to each individual to look after his\/her own needs on his\/her own.  Put another way, it is as if America has given up on itself when it comes to the question of how to protect its citizens from indiscriminate use of guns on America's own streets. There is a satanic smile that tends to agree with your logic AND its futility. Because, unfortunately, statements like these alone will not change the outcome. It will take something much stronger to fix this. And the general public don't believe it exists. It isn't gun ownership that is the problem.  There is no correlation with the percentage of households with guns and gun violence. http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-srv\/special\/national\/gun-deaths\/  There is a significantly higher number of gun deaths per capita for blacks than for whites.  This is a cultural problem, but it isn't an American culture problem it is a poverty and yes racial cultural problem.  There is something wrong in the black and poverty communities that kids are not being taught to value life.  Guns are inanimate objects, they only carry out the actions of those wielding them.  There are countries with much higher rates of gun ownership than the US but with lower rates of gun violence.  We need to address the violent cultures of America not gun ownership. Not an American problem? So black Americans aren't American? \"It isn't gun ownership that is the problem. There is no correlation with the percentage of households with guns and gun violence. http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-srv\/special\/national\/gun-deaths\/\" I don't know what article you read for this fine piece of fictional data but it certainly was not the one you posted a link for.  I did learn a few things in that article though.  For instance the NRA says that the Sandy Hook massacre was just an elaborate suicide for the shooter.  I guess those children and teachers were just \"collateral damage\"!  Just an unavoidable speed bump in the race to greater freedom. According to current gun laws, none of these three boys\/minors could lawfully possess a firearm.  It think the problem is that you can't make their actions any more illegal.  Where do you go?  Punish the parents?  Mandate gun safes?  The default stance for liberals is to take away gun rights for everyone else.  Until they get off this position we will go nowhere. Here in Texas any of those boys could take their money to a gun show, walk around and look at dozens of guns sold by individuals (not dealers), hand the guy the money and walk away with the gun.  You can pretend this isn't true but you'd be in denial.  I've bought and sold many guns in this manner.  I an the only person I've seen who asked for an I.D. for proof of age.  Guns are also commonly sold on gun forums by individuals \u2013 again with no background check and usually w\/o any exchange of information.  This is a giant loophole in the law and something any rational person would choose to stop. Thank you for so eloquently stating exactly how I feel. The reality is that it was totally and completely illegal under current US law for these boys, all of whom were under the age of 18, to possess firearms. US law states the following: Dealers are prohibited from selling or delivering firearms other than shotguns or rifles (e.g., handguns) or ammunition for those firearms to any person the dealer knows or has reasonable cause to believe is under the age of 21. Unlicensed persons may not sell, deliver or otherwise transfer a handgun or handgun ammunition to any person the transferor knows or has reasonable cause to believe is under the age of 18. Exceptions are provided for temporary transfers made for specified activities, including employment, ranching, farming, target practice and hunting. The fact is that these idiots were not using their firearms for the purposes of employment (e.g. they were not police or security officers), they were not ranching or farming (which may require a firearm for the humane euthanasia of injured livestock), they were not members of an approved target shooting club or team, and they were not hunting (which they cannot do alone in OK at their age). The simple reality is that a number of US laws were broken when these idiots came into the possession of firearms and ammunition.  The absolutely key issues are: WHY WAS THE LAW NOT ENFORCED TO THE MAXIMUM? and WHAT TOTAL IDIOT GAVE THESE LOONS ILLEGAL ACCESS TO FIREARMS IN THE FIRST PLACE?  THERE WERE CLEAR SIGNS THAT THESE UNDERAGE PEOPLE HAD ILLEGAL ACCESS TO FIREARMS BEFORE THIS SHOOTING HAPPENED.  WHY DID'NT THE POLICE INVESTIGATE THIS AND REMOVE THE FIREARMS? Did you take a good look at the parents of these three murderers?  People like that should not be allowed to have children...they should be sterilized at puberty.... Well said! You make valid observations.  It is, however, very probable these thugs stole the gun.  Sadly, in our great country, there are WAY TOO MANY THUGS.  We the People need to start aggressively reducing the pool of thugs with either more jail time and\/or more capital punishment. Thank you. Three brutal teens with a gun it was already illegal for them to have, and CNN and Piers Morgan want to use this crime to push a gun control agenda that isn't even relevant here. Why not just have Morgan strip naked and shower in the blood of the victim and have done? It would be faster and less hypocritical. Here in it's dirt-common for teenagers to \"own\" their own rifles.  It's not uncommon for them to hunt without supervision. I'm aware that laws exist to provide some measure of gun safety.  We're all aware that those laws do not control the distribution of weapons.  If you can't control the distribution all that is left is the inventory and capability of weapons.  The longer the N.R.A. nuts avoid the real truth the closer we'll be to the anti-gun crowd supporting extreme laws.  This is a good era for reasonable laws and sensible compromise \u2013 not moronic sound-bites from the extremists on either side. Hi Larry Yes, I know it is common for teenagers in the US to hunt under supervision (just as it is here in NZ).  The key word is supervision.  I don't necessarily want to see teenage hunting stopped.  I agree with you that there needs to be some better laws and better compromises made e.g. why not make gun safes mandatory as they are in Australia and NZ?  Why not make it mandatory to age check people who are purchasing ammunition? FOUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  (Regardless of one's stance on firearms) \"We've all heard about gun violence in America, but this has really brought it home to us here.\" If that isn't the most disingenuous load of CATTLE SCAT I've heard in recent years from an Australian politician... I don't know what is. Unless I am mistaken, Australia\u2019s history and \"culture\" of the gun has walked hand in hand with the U.S., up until the Port Aurthur massacre. Taking an incident, forgetting the reasons, and focusing only on the firearm aspect, is not going to do a thing to stop it; nor is it going to minimize it. Hell, even after the Port Author incident and the resulting legislation and \u201cbuy back\u201d, THE HOMICIDE RATE IN AUSTRALIA WAS LEFT UNAFFECTED.  And there is still firearm ownership in Australia. This was like a few years ago when John Howard started in on firearms in the US, back in 2007 \u2013 Nothing more than trying to score points through depending on those who are ignorant of the facts. \"unless i'm mistaken\" You are mistaken.  I'm calling BS on your whole comment.  What a load of rubbish. Agree and gun use in homicides has come down also: http:\/\/www.aic.gov.au\/dataTools\/facts\/weaponUseTrend.html Actually the homicide rate in Australia has been in steady decline from 1969 to the present. Australians just murder people less than Americans.  Ours is the real land of the free. If you are going to spout statistics about our country, make sure you have the facts by viewing this website first: http:\/\/www.aic.gov.au\/dataTools\/facts\/factsFigures.html The homicide rate in America has trended downward for decades also, despite increase gun sales.  Throws cold water on the theory that more guns=more violence. Good comment here from a fellow British Commonwealth member in Canada.  Canada also has a strict gun law\/\n We are not allowed to carry weapons.  Hunting guns allowed with registration.  No need for joe citizen to carry a gun here but the States is so gun crazy.  I will never understand its love for guns. 'Those who are ignorant of facts'  How ironic! Facts are that gun related deaths from 500 per year to less than 100, so its just NRA crap. Facts are No Australian schools have metal detectors, or the need for armed security guards, the Murder rate is less than a quarter that of US.  There are bored and crazy people is both countries, the only difference is the ACCESS to guns. Australian crazy kids play video games and smoke pot, American crazy kids play with guns and smoke crack...one of these combinations has infinitely worse consequences. If you want to get out of the hole your living in, maybe you can see for yourself, just don't bring your gun, we don't have the stupidest thing ever written on a piece of paper, i.e. the 2nd Amendment. http:\/\/www.abc.net.au\/news\/2013-08-23\/katter-wrong-on-gun-deaths\/4904576 It is awesome how big money in the gun industry have manipulated the US into believing more guns is better, when reality proves otherwise.  But this is just a phase.  When the US finally requires guns to be insured, the insurance industry will shut this down.  For the time being, when 22 school children are shot at school, there is a class-action law suit that falls on the taxpayers to pay.  NO PROBLEM with the 2nd amendment.  But if you have guns, I think you should be required to insure them, so I don't have to pay when your son shoots up the next school.  Then you will think twice (and the insurance companies will make you pay dearly) to maintain your obsession. How does reality prove otherwise?  Check the homicide and crime rate trends in America.  They've been trending downward for decades. Your idea is merely a fig leaf for gun confiscation.  If insurance companies would charge an arm and a leg to insure a firearm then only the rich would be allowed to have guns.  Plus, it's possible that insurance companies would refuse to provide coverage for firearms or bullets.  Then what would happen? You do realize if this man had a gun it would be likely that there would be at least one dead thug, if not more? But instead we have 3 punks alive who will contribute no value to society for their entire lives. How dare you even say that Chris would've shot one of them. You disgust me. That comment just shows how bloody f'd up your head is about guns. My opinion is that most Aussies wouldn't shoot someone even if they're in a situation such as this. That is why we agree about no guns. F You for even thinking that is ok to say. Just because you would doesn't mean everyone would- especially someone who has been raised without even seeing a gun in their life You do know they shot him in the back, don't you?  And do you really think that once shot, he'd be concerned with drawing his gun, aiming and firing at a car that wa speeding away from him?  Really??  You watch too much TV. \"You do realize if this man had a gun it would be likely that there would be at least one dead thug, if not more\" Congratulations, you win \"dumbest comment in the history of the internet\" award. They guy was shot in the back as he was jogging. He never saw it coming. He could have a rocket launcher strapped to himself and the outcome would have been no different. You are a complete and total idiot. Well, if he had a rocket launcher strapped to his back, the thugs may have decided to pick on someone else.... but yeah, a CCW would not have saved this jogger.  Random acts of violence can't be stopped at the act, it has to be stopped before it ever gets to that point.  And that's not an argument for gun control. My understanding is the Australian gentleman was shot in the back. If that's true, his having a gun wouldn't have helped him. What so many people fail to understand is that often, people die at the hands of someone with a gun because they are not in a situation where they have time to prepare to shoot. The fault here is the same as in SandyHook.  One of these \"juveniles\" was in a possession of a firearm which by law is prohibited for them to have.  Therefore, they acquired this firearm by some means.  So Pierce, instead of going on your usual rant about we should have guns in this country.  How about we look at sensible gun laws.  For example, that you turn over your guns to the authorities or responsible gun own if you have a person in your house that is a known threat to society.  This WAS the case in Sandyhook and I would imagine that IS the case here too.  The MOTHER in Sandyhook PURCHASED those firearms for her son and had them in HER house with that \"man\".  The case may be true here where a \"PARENT\" purchased the .22 for their \"child\" as a means of connecting with the poor misunderstood choir boy who was only trying to be a WANNA-BE GANGSTER and have a RECORD of run ins with the law.  Instead, of blaming the \"gun\" culture here.  How about we blame HORRIBLE parenting.  The existing gun laws need to be enforced and perhaps one new gun law.  Here it is, you have to REMOVE the guns from your property if you have a person in your home that is considered a threat to society and if you don't you are partially responsible for the crime. I'm calling Al Sharpton and all of the celebs who want 'in' on the race angle for this story. We need to hype it up week after week ala Trayvon Martin. Hoodies 3 for $10. Waddya say? What about the driver?  He is white.  Spewing hatred around on a broad basis gets kinda messy, doesn't it? I'll bet the white driver listened to rap, wore big baseball caps, didn't wear a belt, had one or more tattoos, and fancied himself a gangsta.  If so, there's a W-word just for him. Death penalty for using a gun in a crime. All of these imbiciles who keep saying that the gun was not obtained legally, so it's nothing to do with America's gun laws are absolutely kidding themselves.   These guns at some stage were legally purchased, then probably stolen or \"stolen\".   Why allow them in the market in the first place?  That's the issue. Because people have the right to self defense.    There's a story out today how a 70 year old shot an intruder just out of prison.   I'm sure he'd be thrilled that you'd leave him defenseless. I question your assumption that guns are purchased legally at some point.  Many guns are smuggled into the country from Mexico and other countries. The black market in guns would only increase if we banned them. It's basic Economics 101. Yes, at some point in the supply chain they were legally purchased.  However, it is still a fact that these children were in illegal possession of these firearms and in illegal possession of ammunition.  The people who allowed this children to have access to the firearms and ammunition with out close supervision also need to be charged. And where are Sharpton and Jesse Jackson? Silent. It was different in the Trayvon Martin issue when I white murdered a black. The black community is in a state of denial and goes violent when they are criticized. Can't keep it hidden. It's now over 12 hours later and Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson plus any other Black ahhhh leader (uncontrolled laughter) have come out and said a word. They run their mouths (like Oprah) about racism and blahh blahhhh. But now it is silent night. you and every other person that tries to compare this to trayvon martin is an idiot. you are calling the black community hypocrites, at least get your facts straight first. since you are an idiot, i will break it down for you. when trayvon martin was killed because he was racially and criminally profiled, the killer was allowed to be free for months. he wasnt even questioned that night.\nin the aussie's case. the 3 suspects were picked up and arrested within hours of the shooting. there is nothing that can be said about that. i will give you a piece of something that will make you feel better about your point though. when crimes happen and a minor is a suspect. the media is not allow to give names or ages or pics. why do you supposed that these three suspects have all of thier info out for the world to see...? Mat, I bet if you were confronted by these three animals you would rather have a gun than not, right?  You're a hypocrite.  I'm not saying that having a gun would have helped the victim since he was shot in the back.  There are violent criminals out there and they could care less if you demand that guns be made illegal.  Go ahead and disarm yourself and leave the rest of us alone.  It's fine to make that decision for yourself and your family but the rest of us will do what we have to do.  By the way, I do not own, nor have I ever shot a firearm but I still believe that guns are the great equalizer and that the right to own them should be defended.  There is no \"gun culture\" in the US.  We have a violence culture. yep that is too funny.  maybe people should let the whole non-racial trayvon martin attack on Zimmerman rest, it is getting too frigin stupid. Myabe this potential victim should not have been allowed to own a gun?  http:\/\/usnews.nbcnews.com\/_news\/2013\/08\/20\/20110801-escaped-prisoner-shot-dead-by-71-year-old-iowa-homeowner-after-hostage-ordeal?lite There are two sides to the whole gun control\/gun prohibition story.  One is the number of violent crimes that lawful gun owners prevent, usually against themselves or their families.  Think of the children. You knucklehead, he used the own man's gun against him !  You're making my point!! the only reason he was able to hold these people hostage was the criminal broke in and took the man's gun.  The only reason the convict was killed was he was dumb enough to walk away from the shotgun for a minute.   The man's gun could have gotten his whole family dead. Uh, John A, read the story again and then feel your face turn bright red.  I'm sure the NRA could find another story for you that wouldn't discredit your point. The old man used an illegal firearm (the perp's firearm) to defend himself and his wife.  How does that disprove my point?  The point is that, because of the gun, this person was able to defend himself. Actually, my apologies, due to your previous comment I thought that I had misread the article.  However, the article simply states that \"But after four hours as a hostage Jerome Mauderly had had enough and retrieved his shotgun, police said.\"    There's no mention of the perpetrator taking the homeowner's shotgun in order to commit the crime.   So I stand corrected and vindicated, my point is valid.  Due to legally owning a gun, the homeowner was able to defend himself. We must abandon our current judicial system for the time being....   Crimes such as this, red handed, confessed, should be judged without trial, and sentence should be carried out immediately!!!  DEATH to these three murderers!  And all those who follow this path!!! When the government no longer enforces laws that protect the citizens, it is the right of the people to establish a new government. See the Declaration of Independence What are you, some kind of radical Muslim? NO!  I AM AN AMERICAN CITIZEN THAT IS TIRED OF THE ESCALATING VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY!   YOU SIR, ARE JUST ONE OF THOUSANDS OF SHEEP, THAT WOULD RATHER SLEEP THROUGH THIS AND HOPE IT EVENTUALLY GOES AWAY!  MAYBE 2016 WILL BRING THE CHANGES THIS COUTRY SO DESPERATLY NEEDS.  AND AS FAR AS PIERS MORGAN GOES, HE NEEDS TO BE MUZZLED LIKE THE REST OF THE PRESS THAT GLORIGY BAD NEWS AND PUT HOPE AND GOODWILL ON THE BACK BURNER! They have become so slick at turning everything to their own advantage. These creeps were underage. Their gun possession was ALREADY illegal. We have been lied to and treated as fools for so long. They won't even refer to this as what it was \u2013 a violent, racial attack. How do you know it was a racial attack?  I've seen no evidence of this.  Are you  assuming this because the victim was white and the shooter was black?  You remind me of all the people who are convinced that Zimmerman went after Trayvon jbecause Trayvon was black.  If the black boys wanted to shoot a white person, why didn't they just shoot the white boy who was driving the car? MR. BRODY, I AM CONVINCED....  YOU ARE INDEED AND IDIOT....LIKE YOUR PREDIDENT! MR. BRODY, I AM CONVINCED....  YOU ARE INDEED AND IDIOT....LIKE YOUR PRESIDENT! Hey Obama.  Is it still time for that discussion on race relations?  Are you going to go on national TV and say that if you had a son he would look like those three cold blooded murderers?  Where are you?  Oh yea, it's not possible for the young man from Australia to be a victim of racism is it?  He is one of the majority who have never been subject to racist behavior due to his race.  I agree with the prime minister down there telling people not to come to the US.  Our president and his cronies like Al, Jesse and those morons at MSMBC have helped create a racially divided country and fuel the fire of hate instead of really having an intelligent discussion about race.  Poor little boys that murdered this guy are victims....that's why they did it.  It's our fault not theirs.  What a crock of crap. What a shame\u2013because close relations with Australia goes a long ways back.  Too bad, we in our Country are gaining a very negative reputation as never before.  Perhaps if we concentrated on the ills and problems in our own nation for awhile instead of suggesting to others what to do\u2013we'd make some progress within our own shores, in short tend to our own business. I mean this with all do respect.. I am so thankful to live in Australia. I don't know anyone who owns a gun nor do I know of anyone who knows anyone that owns a gun! I had a new American student in my class the other day and she was scared to come to school because we didn't have any metal detectors or gun security. This is crazy!!! I can't imagine living in a country where so many people own guns.  We constantly hear about all these gun debates after massacres occur but nothing ever happens! I hope things can change America because we care about you. We are all on this earth together. RIP Chris Thank you Aussie. Unfortunately there are too many people, particularly in the south where they aren't as intelligent, who have bought into the belief that guns save lives. I had a pastor from the south telling me the other day that he belived that we should all have the right to automatic\/semi-automatic weapons with large bananna clips.  Guns and Jesus..  So there is no hope here for reform. Sigh... All I can say is that I wish you all the best Fred. Thank you for your message. Stereotype much?  It's easy to sit back in predominantly white, liberal, well-educated, Northern state and pass judgment on Southerners.  But, if you lived in the South and watched our news, you'd own one or more handguns, hire an alarm company, put your kids in private school, and live as far off in the suburbs as possible.  Politicians and CNN love to make the debate about guns.  But, really, we need to tackle far tougher cultural problems. It's been 50 years since MLK's \"I Have A Dream Speech\" and Jim Crow laws and 150 years since slavery.  It's time to set high expectations for urban youth and eliminate \"thug\" culture completely. I guess Fred is the brain trust, the all knowing.  It's amazes me that its guns that kill and not the person pulling the trigger.  So with this line of thinking I guess pencils cause misspellings.  Background checks do little, the thugs will always have guns no matter what law you pass.  Just like prohibition, there were more secret bars than before prohibition. I bet you are glad to live in Australia where gun violence is so low. I just discovered that the population in Australia is 92% white and 7% asian. Maybe that could have something to do with the low crime rate. Did you just pull that statistic out of your a**??  It's so funny when Americans argue... You make up statistics. Your education system also needs fixing. You need to learn way more about the world not just America. I'm Australian. And i know the family members of Chris Lane. The US is a great country, I've been there. But i tell you what, in Australia we're free, really free. And we can go for jogs at any time of day and night, basically ANYWHERE in the country, including inner city areas. We can do this, because we have a basic notion of \"its cool, its not like anybodys gonna shoot me or something.\"\nWhen is the last time most of you could say that?? This whole thing has rocked our country. The mere notion that by just BEING THERE, you can get a bullet in the back. To us, that's like going to Hell. With so many guns in your country, your INSANE gun violence stats, (and i mean INSANE), we see schools being shot up too often to even count anymore. It doesn't make a damn bit of difference if a kid having a gun is illegal or not, it doesn't matter how many laws try to mitigate the damage...if someone crazy wants a gun to mass murder people, it's relatively easy to get a hold of one. Thats the reality. More guns = more dead Americans, and more dead American children. Im not trying to insult you all, I just really want all of you to understand how things like this affect the perception of America to other western nations. Australia, the UK and inner Europe see whats going with you guys and just shake their head and say \"seriously....what the hell? You're the leaders of the free world?\". Just to be clear, none of us care about whether you're conservative, liberal, white, black, citizen or alien. We just want the blood to stop flowing. Yes!!! I am also sick if hearing all the talk about race! What the heck!?? You're all American citizens! The majority of you like to separate yourselves from each other all the time eg. Race, gender or the state you live in. That is probably why this debate goes around in circles. I am just in complete shock that this can even happen! And to believe there are still stupid people out there that think guns are ok! Are you fricken kidding me!? Wake the F up!! You can only experience true freedom when you live in peace and you the threat of guns doesn't even cross your mind. I wish this for all of you. \"Peace\" is not peace as you know it.  What you think of as peace is actually the absence of the potential for resistance, which is the whole point of gun confiscation. John, Wake up. If the government wants to take your stuff, there is no gun in the world that can stop them. Until you have choppers, tanks, RPGs at your disposal, a gun isn't going to save you from big brother.  Christ.. what a bunch of freaks we have here. I was generally referring to resistance to criminal violence, not government in particular.  Funny how anyone who mentions resisting gun control\/confiscation is labeled a freak. Well John, there are a lot of people concerned that the government wants to target them specifically to take away their posessions.   Are you saying there's not?\nDo you disagree?\nLastly, would you characterise these people as normal? Aussie, what percentage of Australia's population is black? Isn't the black population less than 1%? Could this be a factor in such a low crime rate? Just asking. Fred, I'm sure there are quite a few people who are concerned about the encroachment of government power over their individual rights and property.  For my part, I can understand the concern, especially over the last ten years.  I'm not some Unabomber-type living in a bunker in Montana.  I was born and raised in NYC and I still live here.  I've never owned a gun nor even fired one, yet I can't support draconian gun control laws.  It's truly disturbing how many of my fellow Americans truly believe that gun \"control\" (confiscation, if they're being honest) will make them safer from criminal violence.  Criminals will always be able to get guns, period. Mass shootings are sensationalized yet, anecdotally, the vast majority of gun homicides are one on one, not mass shootings.  It's sad how the actions of one deranged individual leads to demands that hundreds of millions of innocent persons around the country, who did nothing wrong, be punished by reducing their freedom.  So, no, I don't disagree with people who fear their own government.   Of course, some people may not be normal.  I'm not sure how to judge that but I consider myself normal. My opinon is that the main contributing factor to violence in America is not a \"gun culture\" but is due to:  1)  The rise of the welfare state leading to fatherless households.\n2)  Inflation since the sixties which leads to \"latch-key kids\" since both parents are forced to work.\n3)  Continued prosecution of the illogical, insane and disproven War On Drugs, which only serves to criminalize narcotics and create a culture of violence around it, just like Prohibition did with alcohol.\n4)  As an extension of #3, incarceration for minor drug offences.  Prisons turn people into criminals, sometimes violent criminals.  Why destroy a life just because the person was carrying a bit of heroin?\n5)  Gun control laws that allow criminals to be more certain that potential victims will not be able to resist.  Chicago is an good example of all of the above. If you get rid of the Blacks America would be as safe as Australia. Yes.. Because we don't have anyone who is black here ...  Idiot. If you got rid of the \"Blacks\" there would not be an [United States of] America. Ok mate, I'll play along. You from Melbourne? OK.. Why don't you take a jog through Sunshine, Footscray and Dandenong at night, see how that works out. Try catching a Cranbourne train after dark into the outer suburbs. If you're in Sydney, take a jog through Punchbowl at night. You slip this Australia is heaven BS by my ignorant countrymates but I lived in Melbourne for a better part of 8 years, so your BS stops with me.  Let me ask you something, was there an outcry when Indian students were being bashed, maimed and killed on a daily basis a few years back? Not really.. Instead of asking why Indian students were targeted for racial attacks, the aussies simply began foaming at the mouth saying that these bashings were \"isolated\" incidents and it was the Indian students who stood out from the crowd.  The Australian government's solution to the problem was to limit the amount of students visas handed out to Indian students.  I feel for the kid that was shot by these losers, but let's contain the Aussie outrage.  When it comes to street violence, Australia lives in a glass house.  I'm not even going to start with the state of affairs in the Aboriginal communities in the NT.  While living in Collingwood I can tell you that seeing drunken brawls out on the streets was a daily event. Street muggings aren't even reported or properly investigated by local cops anymore.  So let's save the outrage mate, clean up your own house first. Those that want to find out more on the Melbourne Indian student pogroms can just Youtube \"Australia\" + \"Indian students\". Enforce the laws and the problems will be greatly reduced and that means \"profiling\" the minoirites whose 'anger' is directed at themselves and anyone who crosses their paths. This is not gun violence this is people violence from a broken part of our Society where the culture of 'angry blackness' is destroying them and us... x Blacks commit crimes with illegal guns. So you want to disarm whites who got their legally so we can't protect ourselves from the black thugs who got theirs ILLEGALLY. Americans have to deal with this problem because we have violent black thugs in every city. Australia doesn't have this problem. BLACK THUGS are the problem because they get their guns illegally, not legal gun ownership. MAYBE WE'LL SHIP THEM TO AUSTRALIA SO THEY CAN FIND OUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. WHY DOESN'T THE MEDIA TALK ABOUT THE BLACK ON WHITE CRIME PROBLEM? WHY DID THEY SUPPRESS THE KNOXVILLE MASSACRE? SEGREGATION OR SEPARATION MIGHT SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT YOU CAN'T HOLD WHITES ACCOUNTABLE FOR BLACK CRIME. You\u00b4re just a cheesy racist that is pawning off the blame to people you SOLD the guns to .\nYour type and the other monsters of the NRA and the far right bigots are the ones\nthat are REALLY responcible for this . CHECK OUT THIS SITE:   https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/zimmerman.victory Vick- Please go back to school and get more educated. 1. Australia is very multicultural. We don't just have whites people here.\n2.We hear enough in the media about your 'black on white' problem.... Please\n3. Stop generalising  I swear an adult cannot be this idiotic \u2013 can they? Please tell me that you are just a silly 10 year old behind a laptop. Aussie, Although I don't agree with everything he is saying, you are minimalizing the problem by focusing on his personality, the real problem in this country is accountability.  The rules are different if you are white, the government, while trying to make things better for the black community has made it worse by always injecting race into every aspect of their lives.  from buying a purse ( Ophra) to groceries (foodstamps) to schools ( desegregation). If I were black my head would be spinning just to find somewhere race isn't an issue.  The reality is race is not the issue, morals are!  Our culture is being destroyed by the inside for a very ominous reason, taking away our values, hopes and dreams.  Take down the big guy and the rest will tumble...  don't let them kid you, its not about the guns!!! Simply to refute your point number 1, refer to the CIA World Factbook:  https:\/\/www.cia.gov\/library\/publications\/the-world-factbook\/geos\/as.html Ethnic groups:  white 92%, Asian 7%, aboriginal and other 1% Far less ethnic diversity than the US. John A Your statistic is wrong. Also, do you believe all whites are Anglo-Saxon? If you do, please don't bother making another comment and go back to school. JUSTICE ?\nHang them Immediately. They are Not Minors, treat them like adults, they did a crime they have to do time. Justice must be served immediately. No More Sympathy for these 3 rascals.\nthis is their fault Not parents, Not school.\neveryone (Adult) is responsible for his\/her own act. \"Hang them Immediately\"  \u2013 No, hanging them is not the way to carry out justice in 2013\n\"They are Not Minors\" \u2013 Actually, they ARE minors (aged 15, 16 and 17).  Just because you say they are not minors doesn't change the fact that they are minors.\n\"treat them like adults\" \u2013 yes, i think they have been charged as adults\n\"everyone (Adult) is responsible for his\/her own act\" \u2013 okay, what about non-adults?  these three teens are not adults. And the fact remains that these children were in illegal possession of firearms and ammunition under current law.  There are two problems here: (a) why on earth was the current laws not enforced?  The police new these children had illegal firearms and ammunition.  Why didn't the police act and remove these illegal firearms?  and (b) The adults who enabled the illegal possession of firearms and ammunition by these children need to be charged. Don\u00b4t blame the normal everyday people of the U.S. this is the work of republicans and the NRA .\nBy normal I mean people who have to work more hours for less pay and health benefits . The\nmonsteres responcible for this are the far right rich who have bought out our country from\ncheesy congressmen who have no concious or feelings for the poor and middle class Americans . Get off the GOP and NRA crap \u2013 your diatribe is very tiring and of course you CHOOSE to ignore how many lives have been saved by gun owners that have protected their families and their homes in break-ins and robbery attempts. By the way 7 of the 10 richest in Congress are Democrats NOT GOP.  Cheesy DEMOCRATIC tax structures on SMALL and large businesses that PROVIDE jobs have COST jobs and you can thank the Democrats for jobs going overseas to avoid excessive tax burdens.  If you have read history you might recall that we fled England to avoid taxes and now business and people are fleeing here for the same reason.  Look in your Democratic mirror and look at Detroit before you start criticizing the GOP.   by the way I think both parties are to blame but cited Democrats because of your citing GOP.  They both need to have to live under the rules they make for the rest of us. It's just not fair!  ZERO gun killings since '96 you say?  How about we ship about 50 million blacks to Aussie land and see who has the 80 murders per day then? ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF BIASED REPORTING AND NON FACTUAL CONTENT: The usual Piers Morgan distortion of facts. The population of Australia is 21.6 million the population of the United states is 311.8 million. Perhaps that would account for more gun violence in the US seeing that there are 290.2 million more people living in the United States. DUH \u2013 and CNN wonders WHY low ratings? Distorted NEWS and FACTS Um, are you familiar with the aborigine people? Australia has plenty of blacks and as a doctor I can tell you irrefutably that no race is more or less inclined to violence. It's the culture they grow up in and the anger against a society that as you put it, wants to ship them off to another country. You'll find far more poor people in prison than blacks and Hispanics combined. Take a sociology class it will change your life. Take care. What do sociologists have against poor people?  Why is the murder rate less in West Virginia and poor parts of Appalachia than in poor parts of America's cities?  Poor people aren't more likely to kill.  Poor urban African-American people are more likely to kill.  Poor people who have a bad moral compass, anger against the mainstream culture, and who are involved in drugs and criminality are more likely to kill.   It's time for sociologists to stop making excuses for inner city youth.  There needs to be a real tangible consequence for every crime no matter how small.  There needs to be a common set of high expectations for moral behavior and achievement for every member of society regardless of religion and race. Blacks are a federally protected species in America. They're allowed to f* up every community and there's nothing whites can do to stop them, except be armed for our own safety. If Australia and every other country had to deal with this problem, you'd understand. PIERS MORGAN DOESN'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT BLACK ON WHITE CRIME: THE KNOXVILLE MASSACRE, THE  WICHITA MASSACRE, BLACK ON WHITE ATTACKS IN EVERY AMERICAN CITY DAILY. HE HAS TO BLAME LEGAL WHITE GUN OWNERSHIP AND DISARM WHITES SO BLACKS CAN KILL US. NOW, YOU UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM. PIERS MORGAN is an embarrassment to JOURNALISM: The usual Piers Morgan distortion of facts. The population of Australia is 21.6 million the population of the United states is 311.8 million. Perhaps that would account for more gun violence in the US seeing that there are 290.2 million more people living in the United States. DUH \u2013 and CNN wonders WHY low ratings? Distorted NEWS and FACTS Jim, I'm guessing you don't understand what \"per capita\" means. What the prime minister is saying is that you are 15 times more likely to be killed by a gun in the US than in Australia. He is not saying that there are 15 times more gun related murders in Australia than the US, there are around 300 times more gun-related murders in the US than in Australia. The articles I post on this site explain the problem black on white crime and guns.\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/zimmerman.victory Vick Zimmer Really No need for all THIS\u2026\"Blacks are a federally protected species in America. They're allowed to f* up every community and there's nothing whites can do to stop them, except be armed for our own safety\"...This is funny I think you need to relax take a vacation or go on a date or something...These three youths are not the poster child for many black youth in \"OUR\" get it \"OUR\" great Nation not just yours VICK.....So just think sometimes before you write or speak nobodys trying to take what you got..LOL and you shouldn't refer to another human life their animals or something \"Protected Species\" Really.. Grow up and have more uplifting and intellegent responses..But otherwise have a Great day Sir...My Fellow American:) Although I'm not exactly certain, I believe it took only a few days for President Obama to \"speak out\" about the whole Treyvon Martin incident.  Mrs. Obama repeatedly spoke about it.  It's been over 24 hours and I haven't heard a peep out of the White House about this.  In the President's famous words \"any one of these 3 young men could have been my son.\"  Of course, why would he would to admit that. Yeah, you are wrong. Trayvon Martin story didnt even make national news until almost a month later. BO didn't give his speech until that spring once it became a national media fascination. If this becomes as big as the TM story, he would not have a choice but to speak about it. Hell, it was about 3 or 4 days after Sandy Hook until he made a speech about it. You won't its not on their agenda Obama's comment was made 25 days after the shooting of TM.\nZimmerman was arrested 45 days after the shooting. If they'd run him over with the car, we wouldn't be having a gun debate, but people would still have a race debate. It would appear, from this article, that they just wanted to kill anyone. So there goes the race debate if that's true. BUT... It'll always be a gun debate because guns are so widely accessible in America. And it's the dumbest thing we could've done. Guns are designed to hit \/destroy a target. Maim or kill. To hunt. And anybody can get one. Don't get me wrong, I'm not anti-gun. I see where they fit into the scheme of things \u2013 survial , protection, sport, etc... But to not be able to pass universal background checks on something so sensible... it's disgusting. I'm disgusted at America's inability to pass real gun reform. It's mainly so disgusting b\/c the loss of life still cannot hold a light to the Almighty Dollar.  Priorities people. Get 'em straight. I agree however, we should also begin a discussion about the callousness of many young people.  I can't imagine that \" we hust wanted to kill someone\" should be a discussion topic that kids are having... Just because YOU can't imagine it, doesn't mean that isn't what happened. So, when Trayvon Martin gets shot, CNN focuses on race because it fits their beloved white on black crime narrative.  When a white baseball player gets killed by a black teenager, CNN focuses on the guns. Even if it was race-related, we should always talk about how widely accessible guns are in America. Please let Trayvon Martin rest in peace.  It's a shame that the ignorance, predjudice and ill will that cost a young persons life is very much alive and well and on display in forums like this ... And yet, it wasn't on display when three bored kids chose to shoot someone so that they would have something to do???  If you honestly think that the victims race had nothing to do with this, your head is too far in the sand for you to have any comment on this. \"If you honestly think that the victims race had nothing to do with this, your head is too far in the sand for you to have any comment on this.\"  TiredOfTheCrap, What evidence do you have that race had anything to do with this?  Do you know something we don't, or do you just \"feel\" that way?  You are no better than the people who belive that Zimmerman profiled Martin because of his race.  Sheesh! Piers, will stomp on the grave of any dead hero to promote his gun hatred! Kudos CNN for having such a \"wonderful\" person working for you. \"Hero\" \u2013 the new Murcan euphemism for baby-killing, civilian raping, inbred trailer-trash f@gg0ts. Interesting read through the message board on this one.  Typical hate and misguided thoughts \u2013 although, I do agree with those that Piers is a pathetic excuse for a journalist.\nIn this case, the parents of these criminals need to go down for this, too!  I have seen too many photos of their moms and dads crying and claiming they are innocent.  Well, in the end, with all the photos and footage of these kids all over the net pointing\/waiving guns, etc, THE PARENTS ARE TO BLAME.  If they live in your home, keep an eye on what your kids do!  These three \"boys\" obviously didn't have jobs to pay for the computers, phones, etc, that let them post this stuff all over (much less the guns\/bullets).  The parents did, and then didn't monitor their kids.  If one of mine had posted a video like the one on the Vine of the kid pointing the gun at the camera, they wouldn't be out in society to cause any issues for a long, long time.\nIt's time to take accountability for our ability to reproduce.  Too many parents have no issue making kids, but all too often there is no responsibility taken to bring them up.  From the info available on social network about these kids, this did not happen overnight.  It's obvious that none of their parents did even a \"bad\" job at raising them \u2013 that would give the parents too much credit.\nForget about the black\/white, Repbu\/Dem, Gun control, and all that crap!  This particular case is proof that none of those things matter as much as how we raise our kids \u2013 or choose not to raise them. your central theme is to blame...everyone and everything.  What about solutions? The solution is take responsibility when you think that you are mature enough to create a life!  S e x creates a life.  If you are not ready (or able) to raise a child that could come from that act, you are not ready for that act. We as a society have proven that we cannot use birth control properly in any form.  We also know that NO ONE is going to tell us how to behave, or what we can\/can't do with our bodies, so my words fall on deaf ears.\nThese guys were \"bored\", so they killed a guy!  No amount of legislation would have stopped that.  If they didn't have a gun, they could have knifed him.  They wanted to kill someone.  What is  your solution, big fella?\nMine is \u2013 Keep it in your pants if you don't want the hassle of raising a kid! Read the post from Red_Rain:  it is very insightful and thouight provoking (if you're listening and seeking solutions) This is making me re\nthink my position on gun control...enough is enough...as an American I am sick of it, and I am sick of the NRA...I understand people standing up for the second Amendment...but it is clear WE HAVE A PROBLEM.... Congrats for seeing the light.  But why do you understand why people would stand up for the 2nd Amendment?  What militia did these boys belong to? How are more gun laws going to help anything?  It's not like laws against murder prevented these thugs from killing Christopher. And it's not like car safety laws prevented people who died in car accidents from dying. I hate the arguments of \"more laws won't do anything, so why have them at all?\" because there are delusional people who honestly believe that. Okay, let's strike murder, theft, and all those big no-nos from the books. Obviously the laws don't work, so get rid of them\u2013it just puts unnecessary strain on the law-abiding citizens who kill to protect themselves. The leftists in Australia don\u2019t blame the amoral, asocial thugs who murdered a decent human being. No, they blame the gun. As if it had a mind of its own.\" ... \"Hey Tim. The problem isn\u2019t gun control. The problem is crime control.\" You're right, guns don't kill people, people do. For that reason, I'm trying to convince the government to allow me to own a tank. The 2nd amendment is becoming obsolete with all the weapons the government is gathering that could potentially be used against me, so we should be allowed to have tanks. After all, the tanks don't have minds, so they're harmless, and I shouldn't be denied unregulated access to whatever weapons I want because this is \"Land of the Free,\" damn it. What the Prime Minister doesn't know is that blacks can murder at will and they are ALWAYS THE VICTIMS!  Just ask O. J. Simpson.  These three will be treated with preferential treatment because of what people 400 years ago did to their ancestors who died 400 years ago.  Jessie Jackson, Louis Farrakahn, Jeremiah Wright and Al Sharpton should tell their race that THEY WERE SOLD INTO SLAVERY BY THEIR OWN PEOPLE OFF THE COAST OF AFRICA!!  These ignorant, backward, Sociopaths who probably dropped out of school and are burdens on Society will probably never serve any time because they are minors and they are black!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  AND BY THE WAY PRESIDENT OBAMA WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS????????????????????   The silence of the \"Gang of Four and President Obama,\" speaks volumes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What about the white kid who was the driver?  How do you explain him? Based on appearance - NOT \"white\" \u2013 mixed. By the NAACP's own \"one drop rule\", this kid is black. If that kid's \"white,\" then so is Obama.  You can't claim to be a minority only when it suits you. 400 years ago?? huh? The United States wasn't even a country that long ago. Lets try roughly 160 years ago. About 6 generations. Keep in mind that blacks were only allowed basic civil rights barely 50 years ago. My mother(who is only 58) was born in a time where blacks were treated like less than humans. So lets not talk like injustices against blacks are ancient history. WIth that said, we have come a long way as a country. Hopefully when the younger more diverse generation begin to grow and run this country we can start to get past that terrible history. You must be white and totally ignorant. What a dumb comment Ew, ew, ew, I hate when you have people using these situations to try and justify their racist rants. The fact that there are actually people like you in positions of power who believe this crap shows the discrimination against minorities, but in reality, this is a case where 3 kids approached and shot a foreign student without provocation because they were \"bored.\" The fact that human life can be lost so callously is indicative of something truly frightening in this country; guns have virtually become a method of alleviating boredom, and if that doesn't instill concern in you, then there's really no hope. Oh where's the \"do profile me\" people??? Just because of three brain dead hicks shoot some buddy in the back don't lump gun owners in with them or some nut from Conn. or Col.. If your going to do that fine , then start profiling middle eastern males 20-40 years of age comming into to this country. What are you talking about? They get profiled all the time, as do other minorities. I'm all for avoiding making everything into a race issue when it's seemingly irrelevant, but to deny that minorities don't face more discrimination in comparison to Anglo-Saxons is ludicrous. @ brk5239:\nWell said! America is a hell hole, plain and simple, its a sad and pathetic place ...but yet you are here blogging.  I never been to Australia and never care to go.  I don't know the name of your King or President and really don't care.  However, you seem to be all twisted up with America.  Why do you care? It's actually quite nice where I live.  But if you're free to live a life in ignorance if that's what you want. What's it like living in the toilet of the world, where the sheep actually think that they are \"free\" and have \"rights\"? it's actually really sweet here, buddy. Our minimum wage is high enough that we don't need 3 jobs to survive. The streets are safe at any time of day and night. No guns around, low murder rate,  free press with objective journalism, public subsidized healthcare, national disability care, and our Parliament actually puts through laws for the most part.\nAnd we can make fun of our leaders all night, every night, on television. Without getting arrested. How's things on your end? I assumed he was speaking of the US because he made it a point to emphasize \"freedom\" and \"rights.\" Either way, anyone who is content with the state of affairs here really is delusional, especially after this atrocity, but I'm not going to go siding with this guy either, because what good is calling people \"sheep\" from a pedestal going to do? Sir you need to come here to South Central IL, we dont have these problems here in Salem, IL.. I can walk this city all hours of the day and night without fear. We would have more problems with our police than other citizens. Using Gun Control is a COPOUT!!!! It comes down to how you  RAISE your children . Before I allowed my children on social media I wanted passwords. Also wanted PWs for email accounts. Would also walk into their bedrooms to see what they were doing on the computer. Would also check Histories to see where they are going on the internet. PARENTS  need to be held more accountable. I was raised by a single poor mother but she didnt let us run wild or be disrespectful to others. Point.....it IS parenting. can not be put any better! take care of your own and the rest will take care itself I know it is fashionable to blame guns for evil acts but would it not have been just as easy for these punks to run this unfortunate man down with their car.  I mean when someone or some group decides to randomly kill an individual I'm not sure there is much that can stop them.  This is really not a good case for the gun control argument. That's the thing, though: they didn't run him down. With no national gun registration, even if these guns were at some point obtained legally by someone acquainted with the 3 teens, there's no way to trace it back to its origins. Obviously they decided that it was more convenient to shoot Chris Lane than it was to just run him down, which it was, considering there's no need to worry about damage to the car incriminating them. The only reason people keep \"coming back to blame the guns\" is because they're confused why, when guns are obviously part of the problem, we still refuse to even acknowledge that, much less discuss it. \"And yet, it wasn't on display when three bored kids chose to shoot someone so that they would have something to do??? If you honestly think that the victims race had nothing to do with this, your head is too far in the sand for you to have any comment on this\" Race could have been a motivating factor but how can you charge a hate crime when the victim and one of the perps were both white? Another one half white? Doesn't make sense. No one asked you to come to America.  Stay in Australia where you are safe.  Anyone who wants to leave the last time I checked the doors were not locked.  They are plenty of lovely countries with strict guns laws.  I'm sure they would love to have you.  When you leave take shut the door and please take Piers with you. Sure, it\u2019s the \u201cgun culture\u201d. It\u2019s not the vicious cold-blooded murder of a white by blacks BECAUSE of his skin color. No, it\u2019s only a \u201cHATE\u201d crime when a white kills a black. Ala James Byrd. Keep your head in the sand Piers and the rest of America, FOX included. You know, people who are now crying \"hate crime\" are probably guilty of the same hypocrisy they're accusing the other party of. Were all of you insisting that the Martin case was a \"hate crime\"? I won't say my opinion in the matter, because that's not the current issue at hand. Why is the focus on whether or not we should be admonishing the other side for refusing to presume motive instead of looking at the facts of the issue? Guns already are outlawed to these thugs who shot this man.  No new law can make it even more illegal.   Liberals cannot seem to wrestle with that fact. How can anyone believe this is about guns... explain to me the cause and effect of taking guns away from responsible gun owners, leaving only the police officers and criminals with guns.  I have yet to hear or understand how anyone is going to get the illegal guns off the streets.  These kids did not have responsible parents, otherwise they would not have had access to the weapons.  Also, these young men obviously had no up bringing, I would wager they had baby mommas and baby daddy's instead of moms and dads...  this is a cultural problem. Gun control issue? Surely you jest. Hollywood issue? Absurd. The issue here is bad parenting. Ok, so being a person who thinks the lax gun laws in this country are pretty ridiculous, hard to blame them in this case.  These kids were bound for trouble regardless. Lax gun laws? I'm sorry but what are gun laws going to do to prevent a crime like this?  It's not like our laws against murdering someone protected Tim from getting killed. Typo.  I meant to say HIM and not \"Tim\" What about the hundreds of people that are killed by the murderous Australian wildlife every year??  BAN SPIDERS AND SNAKES YOU SQUIRM-NUTS I'll bet you have a..........................REALLY BIG GUN! .......and a tiny little penis. Typical prog d*ck fixation.  When you have no argument, discuss genitalia.. Recycled... is that what the NRA tells you to say? Australia we are sorry, but you don't get it either.  It was the lack of morals.  If no guns were available they would have stabbed him or attacked him with baseball bats or simply run him over.  Would that have made you happier?  When people say they want to kill for fun you can't stop them. People just don't get it.  Its not the guns fault, its the lack of morals. It's \"deep seeded\", not \"seated\". not that I'm pro-gun (I'm relatively ambivalent) but his #s don't make sense \u2013 if US has 80\/day that's 29K\/yr; US population is 14x AUS which on a per capita basis would be 2,076\/yr; if I'm 15x higher per capita (per million is redundant) that still predicts 138 gun deaths\/yr in Australia while he's claiming they have virtually zero. again, I'm not pro-gun but I am pro-math & his doesn't add up... WHY HONEST Americans bear arms: BEDFORD, Iowa \u2013  Authorities say an escaped inmate suspected of shooting a southwest Iowa sheriff's deputy has been killed by a homeowner who said the armed man broke into his house. Rodney Long was shot to death after he broke into a retired farm couple's home in Bedford about 10:15 p.m. Monday, awakening them. Long, who was armed with a handgun, cut their telephone lines and used their cell phone, Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation Special Agent Mitch Mortvedt said. After about four hours, Jerome Mauderly, 71, shot Long with a shotgun in the kitchen of the home he shares with his wife, Carolyn, 66. \"As the situation wore on the decision was made by the Mauderlys they were going to defend themselves,\" Mortvedt said. \"At 2:11 a.m. the Taylor County Sheriff's Office received a 911 call from Carolyn Mauderly.\" She told a dispatcher that her husband had shot an intruder. An Iowa State Patrol officer was nearby and quickly responded, finding Long face down on the kitchen floor, Mortvedt said. No one else was injured. Iowa officers, with help from Missouri officers and a Nebraska State Patrol aircraft, had been searching for Long since Sunday night, scouring about 16 square miles, after a southern Iowa sheriff's deputy was shot, Mortvedt said. They had searched the Mauderlys' property three times. The home is about 5 miles west of Bedford. We need some outrage here....some marches in the streets, maybe a phone call or two from Chairman Obama...sign up some celebs who need some 'righteous indignation' cred...you know...make the media rounds. C'mon folks, lets play their game-it could be a lot of fun. sarcasm off. The liberals and  gun grabbers and the liberal media who are salivating for another shooting story ..will blame racism if a black person is shot by a white person..and if a white person is shot by a black, it's the guns fault...And if it is blacks shooting other blacks which by far is the most common,the media will largely ignore it.....Pathetic. Let's stop confusing \"gun culture\" with \"thug culture.\"  Statistics don't lie...the percentage of gun owners who commit crimes is significantly lower than the percentage of blacks who commit crimes.  Enough beating around the bush, let's call this what it is and face it head on. Exactly!  More gun laws won't solve anything. It will only restrict the rights of law abiding citizens.  We need better education, better parenting, and much more severe punishments for crimes such as this. A couple of new studies reveal the gun-control hypesters\u2019 worst nightmare\u2026more people are buying firearms, while firearm-related homicides and suicides are steadily diminishing. What crackpots came up with these conclusions? One set of statistics was compiled by the U.S. Department of Justice. The other was reported by the Pew Research Center. According to DOJ\u2019s Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. gun-related homicides dropped 39 percent over the course of 18 years, from 18,253 during 1993, to 11,101 in 2011. During the same period, non-fatal firearm crimes decreased even more, a whopping 69 percent. The majority of those declines in both categories occurred during the first 10 years of that time frame. Firearm homicides declined from 1993 to 1999, rose through 2006, and then declined again through 2011. Non-fatal firearm violence declined from 1993 through 2004, then fluctuated in the mid-to-late 2000s. And where did the bad people who did the shooting get most of their guns? Were those gun show \u201cloopholes\u201d responsible? Nope. According to surveys DOJ conducted of state prison inmates during 2004 (the most recent year of data available), only two percent who owned a gun at the time of their offense bought it at either a gun show or flea market. About 10 percent said they purchased their gun from a retail shop or pawnshop, 37 percent obtained it from family or friends, and another 40 percent obtained it from an illegal source. While firearm violence accounted for about 70 percent of all homicides between 1993 and 2011, guns were used in less than 10 percent of all non-fatal violent crimes. Between 70 percent and 80 percent of those firearm homicides involved a handgun, and 90 percent of non-fatal firearm victimizations were committed with a handgun. Males, blacks, and persons aged 18-24 had the highest firearm homicide rates. The March Pew study, drawn from numbers obtained from the Bureau of Justice Statistics and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, also found a dramatic drop in gun crime over the past two decades. Their accounting shows a 49 percent decline in the homicide rate, and a 75 percent decline of non-fatal violent crime victimization. More than 8 in 10 gun homicide victims in 2010 were men and boys. Fifty-five percent of the homicide victims were black, far beyond their 13 percent share of the population. Forbes, May 2013 But, but, but,  \u2013 guns don't kill people, people kill people.\nIf only he had been jogging with an AK-47 he would have been so much safer....\nGun idiots. Remember \u2013 bombs don't kill people either!  People kill people.\nThe denial and ignorance of the rabid, pro-gun at all costs minority has and will cause the death of thousands of more innocents. People have been murdering people for millenia, and in America's current moral wasteland you call a culture, do you really think banning guns is going to change that?  Talk about denial and ignorance, you'd rather slap a bandaid on a gaping wound than sew it up right.  Maybe you'll see a decrease in gun crime, but the underlying causes of that crime will still be there, and people will find alternatives to firearms. Clueless; when people want to kill they will and guns will not deter them and these lost boys wanted to kill \u2013 for FUN! your the minority idiot. my grandma would be dead if wasn't for having a gun when 3 idiots broke into her house!!!!!! go live in europe if its so bad here Speaking of violence, does anyone remember that time Jeremy Clarkson punched Piers Morgan in the face?  I chuckle every time I think about it. Here is what Mr. Fischer and those who don't live in the US fail to understand about our country....money trumps all.  Politicians don't rule our country, corporations do.  And there is a LOT of money being made by gun manufacturers and those who run the gun shows.  That is a gravy train that will be impossible for the average American to stop. Nice strawman you got there.  No actual American is interested in changing the second amendment. Only progs who think that history began with the day of  their own birth believe that there needs to be a change in the rights of Americans because of a few sick puppies.  Tell you what stud, let's do something sensible like make people show ID before they vote.  Then we can talk about your gun fear and why I should care about it.  Keeping beating that tin drum though. Barry and Pierce are so proud Sorry, you can try that line but we know it to be the typical liberal line.  You will NEVER correct crime with less guns.  Only when morals are corrected will we have a less violent society. Fischer left out that home invasions are up 400% and dozens of people are beat to death weekly in their homes by Muslims or drug addicts. Why? They know there are no guns. Greetings from Sarah Palin, the tea party patriots and the NRA. Is that supposed to be an \"argument\"? Your jealousy of actual functional adult humans is laughable.Interesting how you dogs return to your own vomit.  Is that you pierce?\nIt can't be ! You moved back to your gun free paradise!  I think Pierce should donate every dollar he earns to this family. You know , to show us cretins how the Euro trash do it! \"This Canadian will be spending travel dollars in more civilized countries.\" Please take PIerce with you! So when a hispanic kills a black with a gun it racist, when blacks kill whites, it gun control.  Where is Sharpton.  You liberals S U C K!! Everytime I think of Sarah Palin I think of trailer trash. Everytime I think of trailer trash I think of tea party patriots. Everytime time I think of tea party patriots I think of nascar. Everytime I think of nascar I think of assault weapons. Everytime I think of assault weapons I think of Sarah Palin. Everytime I think of Sarah Palin I think of trailer trash. Everytime I think of... Progressivism is a mental disease ( see above nursery rhyme).I'm sure that this nursery rhyme makes sense to the poor drooling , gibbering soul that wrote it.  The reason progs want to take your guns is that they project their insanity on you. When you are crazy , you think that you are the only one who is sane. It's not gun culture, it's gang culture. We arrive in rusty 1964 motorhomes.\nWe bring our bibles and loaded assault weapons.\nWe wear ridiculous clothing and have teabags dangling from our earlobes.\nWe carry misspelled racist signs as we stomp all over the White house lawn.\nWe eat Chick-fil-A and wash it down with Everclear.\nWe are Sarah Palin's real Americans.\nWe love the baby jesus but we love to boink our cousins even more.\nWe believe that the earth is only 6,000 years old and that early man walked with the dinosaurs.\nWe believe that nascar is a real sport and that Dale Earnhardt was a great American athlete.\nWe are the birthers. We are tea party patriots.\nWe are bigots and inbreds. We are morons and we are proud. we dont shoot people in the back because we feel like it Yep, that pretty much sums up the conservative movement. I can tell your not a racist.  That's very good logic blame it white trash cause 3 black kids killed a white.   for you idiot comes to mind.   Im sure your a Obammy  supporter.  @ dee 5010  yes I would if I knew that that trash was carry a weapon.  say what you want but most crimes are committed from black youth , parentless or single parent families,  FACT.  Address the real problem instead of blaming bush Would agree with you if your facts were correct.... which they are NOT!!!!!  One of the teens arrested was white.  Also, per the FBI reports in 2011 (2012 is not released yet), most crimes are disproportionately committed by WHITES!!!!   This isn't biased, it's the FBI report.....  http:\/\/www.fbi.gov\/about-us\/cjis\/ucr\/crime-in-the-u.s\/2011\/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011\/tables\/table-43 Does not matter what race they are.  Wrong is wrong! You should not be using the absolute numbers from that FBI report but translate it to a percentage compared to the demographics of the entire country.  As of 2010, the US population was estimated to be 72.4% White and 12.6% Black.  See http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Demographics_of_the_United_States#Race_and_ethnicity  The FBI webpage shows a total number of approx. 9.5mil crimes of which 6.578mil were committed by Whites and 2.697mil were committed by Blacks.  On a percentage basis that is 69.24% committed by Whites and 28.39% committed by blacks. So, following the numbers, about 28.39% of crime is committed by 12.6% of the population (about 2.25:1 ratio) while 69.24% of the crime is committed by 72.4% of the population (about a 0.96:1 ratio).  It would follow that, statistically speaking, Blacks are 2.34x as likely to commit a crime as compared to Whites.  Someone please check my math, because I may be looking at the numbers wrong.  This is for all crimes (violent, property, white collar, etc.)  I did not break out violent crime only, although it would be possible to do so with the FBI data provided. Also, to be clear, the FBI report does not break down the offenders life situation (single parent family, prior offences, etc.). Accurate! He is right!! I'm angry at the black community too \"I just want to say that it would appeal to the deep thinkers in the USA to think again about the drift in the state of the nation.\" There are none. I've been sorta depressed lately, so I will just come out and say it. I'm American. And that's where it ends. I'm not proud of it. I don't feel good about what I see and hear every day. Sirens wailing down the street. People, all black, walking down the street, their pants sagging down to their knees saying n*gger this and n*igger that. I don't like seeing trash on the side of the road, vomit outside my house, dog crap on the sidewalk. I don't know. This whole story just makes me sick. It reminds me of all the reasons why I hate this place. And please don't remind me that if I don't like it I can leave. I know that. I also know that other places are worse. It\u2019s really not this place I hate. It\u2019s this entire world. Do you know the only thing I'm thankful for? The only thing I enjoy? I enjoy sleeping and riding a motorcycle. But the very minute I see another person, I am prepared to give up something that he\/she needs. They invariably need something. Money. A favor. They always need something. But like I said, I'm depressed, so... This is not about guns.\nIt's not about race.\nIt's about morons with no parenting skills giving birth to morons with dangerous fantasies.\nThat Australian kid was wonderful, and I hope if there's something after this miserable existence on Earth, he's in a far better place. it is just a matter of time before lynch mobs become the norm and these black thugs and child abusers and the like are dragged from their low places., jail cells, court room and murdered in the streets where and as it should be done. we need to make this a reality so that fear creates a better behaved subculture we are stuck with thanks to free meal tickets ala wellfare and free living for these black brood sows. So I suppose you would do the same to all the white criminals arrested is much HIGHER rates per the FBI report?!?   Nice try though!!!  How about reporting facts instead of nonsense. http:\/\/www.fbi.gov\/about-us\/cjis\/ucr\/crime-in-the-u.s\/2011\/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011\/tables\/table-43 This is a repost because you continue to cite statistics without adjusting for the actual demographics of the country: You should not be using the absolute numbers from that FBI report but translate it to a percentage compared to the demographics of the entire country.

It is an unfortunate fact that people are arrested and convicted for crimes they did not commit and that there are people who do commit crimes for which they avoid arrest and\/or conviction. Fair enough, that is a possibility.  I was only using the data that the original poster presented in a misleading way. What stricter or harsher gun law would have saved this man since these youths were breaking at least 20 guns laws right from the start? Exactly!  Gun laws NEVER apply to criminals! OK, so Piers Morgan tries to focus the problem on gun laws. But really, everyone knows that is African American criminals who cause us to be viewed negatively by the rest of the world.  That's African American criminals from the ghetto right on up to the White House. Lets call it what it is Piers. Take a look at the 2011 FBI \"Crimes in the United States report (2012 isn't out yet).  Staggering disproportionate amount of crimes committed by whites..... nice try though!!!!! http:\/\/www.fbi.gov\/about-us\/cjis\/ucr\/crime-in-the-u.s\/2011\/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011\/tables\/table-43 This is a repost because you continue to cite statistics without adjusting for the actual demographics of the country: You should not be using the absolute numbers from that FBI report but translate it to a percentage compared to the demographics of the entire country.

Another note:  The FBI data is of reported crimes\/crimes committed.  Whether or not the statistics represent actual convictions or miscarriages of justice is unknown. what do you expect from sub human animals and thugs that have no more than the education of a feral dog? we need to make the loss of citizenship and deportation the law of the land.,\ndeport the entire family extendedmembers too and either execute or jail these criminal offenders immediately after trial., then deport them back to Africa or where ever when they are released., white? or black commit a crime?\nblame the government you supposedly voted for?\nyou can be deported too.,\nI hear the E.U. has a good economic outlook may be if this country is so messed up you can self deport? America for Americans and good people need to apply., all others should be removed ,deported and or culled like diseased cattle. I wonder if Australia would allow reasonable, lawful Americans to emigrate there as refugees of the civil war that seems to be gripping the U.S.  I feel so powerless and sad about the death of this promising young man.  And, I'm nobody special or important, not like our Prez, but if I had had a son, I would like to think he would have been like Christopher Lane. It is not about the guns, it is about the lack of punishment for the crimes. this engineered thug class helps to destroy America every day and it starts in the farms called public schools where you are placed on a path or you are removed from the government plantation\/ farm and become part of this thug class because you do not fit the mold for the new world order citizen oh I mean \"worker\" or government stooge or political lakie stooge. If you ask too many questions are too smart you are removed from the farm as quickly as they can get rid of you. America's gun culture?  No.  America's thug culture.  Don't lump responsible gun owners in with ghetto trash CNN.  Disgusting. Most of the homicides in this country are done by people who vote, would vote if they could, democrat.  Sorry.  Don't blame this on the right for your culture of violence. As much as it pains me to see the gun violence, I would *NEVER* support the disarming of civilians. The US Federal government has proven time & again that it cannot be trusted with protecting our rights.  There is no doubt in my mind that, eventually, this will lead to a popular uprising.  It is only a matter of time before some world event puts our economy so deep in a hole that no matter of flag waving or misdirection will convince the people that everything is going to be all right.  People will starve in the streets, and you'll see a French Revolution... heads rolling. No doubt Obama, Bush, and the rest of the American Nobility would LOVE to disarm us... And they'll continue to try. But it won't happen.  Ever. Once again...this has nothing to do with guns, it has more to do with the three BLACK men who can't act like civilized human beings One of boys was white.... nice try though!!! Does no good to argue with these GOP clowns.  Their logic:  All blacks are thugs.  Thugs shoot innocent people.  Therefore, this boy MUST be black.  Up is down, over is under and out is in! makes snese to them! See? in america even killers appreciate diversity! USA!USA!USA! THE FACES OF EVIL.  These little \"Blac: boys are not EVIL!!  With this being displayed in such a way, people will look at little black boys as EVIL.  Let me tell you what is EVIL.  That their ancestors were brought to this county in a EVIL way!  That the very people who posted this are just as EVIL.  America has a EVIL history to say the least.  RACISM.  Yeah I said it!  These boys did a horrible act YES!  But they are not EVIL.  They are lost and confused in a nation that is unequal to this day, and has fallen short in MANY ways!  So do not JUDGE.  The movies, the media, the violence is all around and they just depicted what they see \"EVERYDAY\".  If they would have had afterschool, summer programs etc, to keep them off the street, then EVIL would not happen!  AMERICAN GET A GRIP ON LIFE AND NOT A GUN! And now we have apologists for evil.  Slavery bad \u2013 we get it.  But it is not racism that caused this no matter what you say!  If blacks don't like it here LEAVE; there are plenty of successful blacks \u2013 the difference is between their morals.  Quit making excuses for evil.  The mere fact that you would even say something like this suggests you yourself are EVIL! I see nothing but sick and pathetic excuses from you PB.  Murdering someone in cold blood like that is ENTIRELY evil.  If you believe otherwise, then you need your head examined. I abhor the treatment of slaves by whites in the United States; but just remember that it was the African blacks themselves who captured and then SOLD their less fortunate people as slaves to whites and others.  Slavery is still going on in Africa.  This does not excuse what the white landowners did with them once they got them, but everyone including the powerful blacks in Africa were involved and in on the slave trade!  So what the hell, you cannot blame just the whites, look at everyone, look at human nature unchecked by religion, ethics, values or morals!! What if they had killed him with a baseball bat instead of a gun? Perhaps run him down with their car. What would these schmucks propose be done then?\nAs long as the human species is predisposed to kill one another they will. There doesn't have to be a \"good\" reason. Shutting the door on gun possession does nothing to abate that fact. More innocent people are killed by drunk drivers than guns yet nobody is clamoring for the removal of cars or a reenactment of prohibition. How can the twits make like for like comparisons of the two countries when Australia has a population of roughly 24M people while the U.S. has approximately 313M. They would be best served if they kept their politics on their own shores. Its not the same at all if they went after him with a baseball bat or hand combat.    You are comparing armed to unarmed, and its not the same.  If they launched a physical assualt on the guy, at least he would have a CHANCE to fight back and escape!  He might have been able to grab a rock or a tree branch or use martial arts or just all out run for his life to escape.  Physical Assaults require a close proximity to the victim, a gun does not.  The gun gave the killers a grossly strong advantage over the victim, complete anonymity for them during the attack, and without any forwarning at all, the vitcim has absolutely no course of action to take to protect himself because he is totally unaware he has a gun aimed at him.  This is why he had no way to survive the outcome of the shooting.  With a physical assault, he would have had a chance to affect the outcome and might have survived. Rubbish; they could have run him over with a car.  People determined to kill ALWAYS can find a way..... If it happended in Sandy Hook, it can happen any place. We  have done nothing to fix the problem, and so it continues. To all Austrailans, be grateful you live there and not here. We have a shameful Congress. Say a prayer for fthe amiles. Senseless. Please be outraged, Australia, because we sure as well won't. \u2013 Sincerely, The United States *Report Chemical Weapons Attack In Syria Kills 1,000+* Go get those terrorist meanies, Jerry. Just make sure that you are unarmed. Those three kids should be publically executed on live television! Public execution would put a stop to this type of senseless crimes! The answers as to why we have or don't have certain laws are relatively simple.  Just follow the money.  That's what drives nearly everything in our lives nowadays.  The gun lobby has tons of money and Congress today is bought lock, stock and barrel by the various lobbies in America.  It doesn't matter what the polls say that the majority is for or against.  On the other hand, you cannot be elected to Congress unless you can raise truck loads of money, so to get in you have to sell your soul.\nWe all know that modern societies that can be compared to the US are a lot safer due to their gun regulations.  We also know that most modern countries have overall much better healthcare (overall, not anecdotally) for much less money than we spend in the U.S.  You can go on and cite dozen of other examples, e.g. public transportation.  But none of that matters so long as those interests with money benefit from the laws and regulations being what they are and their self-interests outweigh any interests for the kind of country we could be.\nWe stopped being a democracy a long time ago and Citizens United only pushed it over the cliff.  Unfortunately, all short-term solutions would involve only non-democratic means.  Not necessarily violence, but autocratic decisions such that lobbying would become illegal for instance.  I don't think America is ready for that yet, but it may get there if the divide between the haves and have-nots increases, although there are many other societies with even greater chasms that have survived these inequalities unscathed for very long periods of time. If Pres Obama had a son, perhaps he would look like one or more of these 3 thugs... If Pres Obama had a son, perhaps he would look like one ore more of these 3 thugs... This is real sad that he was killed,(And a big fan of Baseball) hearts and prayers go out to his family.. But there is anger towards every American cause of 3 Murderers..Let's be real..3 losers don't depict how every American is. Typical irresponsible, liberal journalism jumping on \"America's gun control\" and not the punk thugs who pulled the trigger. This tragedy is but one among thousands committed by punks all over the country every year.  And this being a black on white crime, will we hear any outrage from the NAACP and other African-American race-based self-interest groups?  Don't hold your breath. This sad event doesn't score them any money or media highlights. How come, on the Trayvon story, all you heard was a white guy killed a black kid for months, but Pierce , in his story last night, never ONCE mentioned it was 3 black thugs shooting a white guy??!!!!!!  Where is Al Sharpton condemning this shooting?  Star Jones last night and in video clip, says the poor boys who shot the kid, their lives are changed forever also.  wah wah.  We should revert back to the old days and hang these kids.    Then in Pierces following story, afetr he has ranted about removing guns, his story is on an elderly couple that needed to protect themselves from a prison escapee intruder.  If they were required to turn in their guns 6 months ago, they would be dead now.  Unfortunately we are to far down the slope of a degraing society, where honest people need a way to protect themselves. Piers Morgan wrote that Australia's gun control reforms \"has virtually eliminated firearm crimes in the country.\"  Evidently Piers has not come out of his liberal \"fantasy land\" long enough to check some actual statistics.  news.com.au reported August 2, 2013 that there have been 39 people shot in Sydney this year.  Conservative estimates say there are more than a quarter-of-a-million illegal firearms in Australia, and there has been a steady increase in gun-related crimes over the past seven years.  \"In the seven years from 2005 to 2012, gun murders across Australia almost doubled. The incidence of guns used in kidnappings trebled. The total number of crimes in which a firearm was used rose from 823 in 2005, to 1217 in 2012, an increase of 47 per cent.\"  You can find the article here, http:\/\/www.news.com.au\/national-news\/is-australia-staring-down-the-barrel-of-a-gun-crisis\/story-fncynjr2-1226690018325\nSo despite Piers Morgan's wishful thinking, gun control has NOT \"virtually eliminated firearm crimes\" in Australia.  Some reports say that gun control in Australia has actually increased violent crime, as gun-toting criminals are now assured that their victims will be unarmed!\nInstead of turning this horrendous murder as an excuse to score points for the liberal gun-control agenda, why not take a hard look at the factors that actually led to the attack, and try to find some solutions. The issue is that Australian crime is lower to start with is also a factor. in this case, a lack of thorough crminal background check and easy access to firearm by said perps. we're a violent society and unless any sensible controls are enforced... rinse, repeat. just hope and pray it doesn't happen to you and anyone you know. i don't think carrying my sidearm would have prevented me from getting shot in the back in this instance. Guns are a problem (in the sense that too many criminals end up with them) but so is race-based anger and out of control violent crime disproportionately committed by African Americans.  Until elected officials, academia, and the media, seriously discuss and acknowledge this, and demand personal accountability for one's behavior, nothing changes in America. Of course there is a God; just because you can't see him doesn't mean he doesn't exist.  Suppose you don't believe in air either.... Amen! It's a great tragedy, that 3 confused young men* decided to shoot that young man, and I'm SURE that, since none of them are judges' kids, they will probably spend the rest of their lives in prison. However, I don't think we should start letting UK agents (Morgan and Murdoch, for starters) tell us how to run the country. So, while it's nice to look at him, I don't think we should listen to Piers Morgan. We will get more done, listening to each other, instead of the talking heads. *In the aftermath of the wrongful profiling, stalking, chasing and shooting to death of Trayvon Martin, MOST Americans are upset, and the Murdoch Media has often stirred that pot. This wouldn't be a racial crime would it?  Blacks killing a Caucasian?  Probably not.  If not already the Rev Sharpton will undoubtedly blame this shooting on our society, not the ones doing the killing.  One mother has said that her boy is a good boy. So maybe Americans should not go to Australia . . .\nAmerican man stabbed to death in Sydney Posted Sat 23 Feb 2013, 11:59am AEDT  Map:  Cecil Hills 2171\nA woman has been refused bail after being charged with the stabbing murder of an American man in Sydney's south-west. Emergency services were called to a Cecil Hills home just before midnight last night, after hearing reports a man had been stabbed. When they arrived, they found a 32-year-old US citizen with chest injuries. He was rushed to Liverpool Hospital by ambulance but died a short time later. A 31-year-old woman was arrested at the home and has since been charged with murder. She faced Parramatta Bail court this morning and was denied bail. Police say the man and the women were known to each other. WHOA!!!  This is BIG NEWS!!  An American was stabbed by an Aussie in Australia!!  This is the proof that the NRA has been looking for!  This means that tightening gun laws in America won't work.  Congratulations, you've finally convinced Americans of the futility of controlling guns! i'm shocked piers didn't try to make the perps out to be the real victims here. these three should be killed \u2013 shot in that back of the head.  THEY WILL NEVER BE ANYTHING BUT THUGS.\nLETS START ELIMINATING TRASH LIKE THIS.  MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. Sad commentary but the sentiment behind it, the notion that enough is enough of protecting, justifying punk-thug behavior is one that must make its way back to main stream America or we are doomed as a society.  Evil punks will have their way if decent people don't fight back.  And the fight begins with disproving the foolish belief by liberal whites that money thrown at social ills will fix all. Americans are outraged at this senseless act as well. I am embarrassed to be an American because our leader and all his friends promote uneducated and unfit women to have babies with all of their welfare and free subsidies. Have a baby and we will feed it through the WIC program for four years, then place them in pre-k to feed and babysit them, and then give them free breakfast and lunch from k-12th grades all thanks to the 48% of Americans who pay taxes. In addition, we will give your momma welfare. We Americans wish the minority population would stop having children but they have them fast than any other race. We are sickened that such a nice kid was killed. I WOULD NEVER SEND MY CHILD TO THE US and I am a US citizen. I fear for my son every day because everywhere you look their are thugs. Dangerous country! Smith Good point smith... all have  to do is change people like JAMES AKABUG.  Now that you've proved  guns are not at fault, how do you plan to fix stupid people, so they shoot and kill us? Let me guess we can reform television and Holllywood, get rid of the liberal media, revamp are educational system, arm all the white teachers and white school children, make individuals and families take personal responsibility, and purge evil from hearts of men. Sounds like a much simpler solution than common sense gun reforms... Quote: \"Tim Fischer championed Australia's gun control reforms, an effort that has virtually eliminated firearm crimes in the country. \"  The uninformed comment of the year.  There are daily shootings in western sydney alone. Obama hates whites people Tough talk from an island country that isnt being invaded from the south, deluged with drugs, didnt fight for independence, fight to free its slaves or sneak attacked. TERRIBLY sorry about your countryman but america is what it is. Please feel free to boycott, we still got your six. Typical American arrogance I'm disappointed CLinton News Network! Not one instance of mentioning these kids are part of the tea party like you usually do with gunmen! Not one instance of trying to connect them with Limbaugh and blaiming him for it! I'm curious is Obama going to take responsibility and say these coulda been his kids like he did with Trayvon! Where's Jesse jackson or Al sharkton on this issue like he was there for Trayvon Martin?! Oh, if only it were illegal for teenagers to get guns, oh, wait... waaah if only it were MORE illegal for teenagers to get guns waah! I'm bored1 Maybe it's time to listen to some rap music and make gangsta signs! is no one seeing the silver lining here? That this proposed boycott may actually result in fewer Australian tourists visiting the U.S.? That actually sounds too good to be true. If every country were to boycott visiting this country until we controlled the sale of guns, maybe something good would come of this As an Australian from Melbourne, like Chris, who has been living in the US (Los Angeles) for a number of years, this case has been of personal interest to me. I can fully say that I love the US and admire the opportunities it presents and have met so many wonderful people over here, including my American fiance, and have seen so many beautiful places.  I've driven cross country and have visited the majority of this country's states. However, the one aspect that shocks me, and many other Australians, is the rampant gun violence and the lack of gun control in this country.  Like some other Australians have aforementioned, I find it hypercritical that the folks who rant that gun control takes freedoms don't know the freedom of not worrying about someone else having a gun during your daily errands or someone shooting you.  There is a certain apprehension I have while traveling in American cities that I wouldn't have in Australian cities, or the cities I've been to in Asia or Europe. Most Australians, myself included, don't understand how the most powerful country in the world, which often polices human rights and laws in other nations, allows its own citizens to carry firearms with minimal checks and continual mass murders of its own people.  We're shocked that few in US government have the backbone (or delicately put: \"the b*lls\") or foresight for future Americans to place bans on guns.  When the conservative John Howard administration placed an all-out gun ban in Australia in 1996, we heard the same arguments that we'd be losing our freedoms and we'd be less safe.  Turns out that we are a safer, more stable society and don't have violent crime that plagues the US.  I didn't particulary like John Howard, but admire him for having the courage to not cave-in to interest groups and political pressure. The US does have the pesky thing called the 2nd Amendment, which some folks swear by.  That law was written at a time over 230 years ago when the US was still at risk of a British invasion.  The writers of the original Bill of Rights could not envision semi-automatic weapons and the destruction they could do.  That amendment is outdated and does not apply to modern society.  Yet many still believe it gives folks the God given right to have firearms in their suburban homes where children, as in this case, can have access to them.  The NRA folks state that guns are the only solution to qualming fears, as everyone will be prepared if they are robbed or attacked.  Why don't we just allow folks to protect themselves with grenade launchers?  Ridiculous? Yes, but not any different in concept. Some also state that if Chris had a gun, he could've protected himself.  Come'on guys!  The NRA expects us to jog around our neighborhoods clutching a gun just in case someone attacks?  That doesn't sound like freedom to me and sounds more like an oppressing militia.  I'd take my freedoms in Australia, or any other Westernized country, over that anyday.   If the assailants did't have guns and were intent on attacking Chris with a baseball bat or a knife, they would've had to have come in close proximity to him, giving him a chance to fight back or run.  A gun gave him, or the countless other victims shot in the US, no chance to survive or defend themselves.   Sadly, the logic of this country when it comes to firearms is absurd and needs to be revised.  I know there are many Americans who agree with me and it is just a fraction of citizens who won't let their guns go.  Unfortunately, those folks have given America a bad image to other nations, including to Australia which is one of America's closest allies, and have unknowingly made this nation a more dangerous place.  As much as I love the US, it is with a heavy heart that once my fiance completes grad school, we will seriously consider moving back to Australia because of the public safety, and to the shock of the NRA, the greater freedoms we have.  I wish all of my American friends the best of luck on this social issue Ryan, why is Utah's homicide rate the same as Australia's, even with liberal (i.e. permissive) gun laws? Why did the US homicide rate decline at a very similar rate to Australia's after Aus passed their big gun ban in the 90s? Hi BSH,\nAs a casual observor, I don't know of any numbers to back your claims.  From a personal and localised perspective, I do remember crime dropping here in Los Angeles in the 90's; namely due to tighter law enforcement against gang activity.  Whether that action reflects the rest of the nation, I don't know.  The drop in murders here in the US had no bearing or relation to the drop in Australia. As far as Utah, are you speaking of per capita murders or the total amount of murders?  If it's the same number of murders as Australia, then that would be a dismal record given Utah's much smaller population.  If you are speaking of per capita, which I don't have any numbers to back your claim, but if it is true, it could be due to Utah's more rural population with SLC being the sole major metropiltan area.  If that's the case, it would only be far to compare Utah to an Australian state, such as Western Australia, that has only one major city as well (Perth) and a similar population and rural percentage.  I'd be certain the numbers favor WA.  It'd be unfair to compare more populated regions of Australia, like Victoria or New South Wales, to rural parts of America. Where's Alex Jones?  We need him to spew venom and fecal matter in retalliation, at the mourning Australian family, and Australian spokesman. Quoting ...\"...people are thinking of going to the USA on business, vacation, trips, should think carefully about it given the statistical facts you are 15 times more likely to be shot dead in the USA than in Australia per capita per million people.\"\" Yes, and you are also about 15 times more likely to be struck with a small asteroid than a larger one. .... but should we really worry about either ? This murder is a horrible incident and deserves severe punishment, but it is certainly not a reason to not visit America and enjoy many of America's wonderful people and places. I really love Australia. They tell it like it is. Come here, settle down, but keep your b.s. to yourself. I don't blame them for being mad. Our country seemingly has lost its backbone all in the name of freedom of speech and expression. Wearing pants so your fanny shows should be banned. Thuggery type behavior should be curbed. Who would have ever thought we would have to be a country to tell certain kinds of young people to pull up their pants, and being a thug is not a wise career choice. But it looks like we have to help these youngsters set their compass in another direction. The world is learning about giving in to ridiculousness through the United States. Maybe its time to bring art, music and theatre back into the school system; where posers like these youngsters can act out safely, instead of taking a life on a lark. I'm not hating, I'm just tired of it. In my day, bands were like for getting high; not for bieng arrested with guns. \"Hating Whites\" is just hating the sorry situation their life is in. Nothing will help as long as we celebrate thuggery as being a desirable status. \"I just want to say that it would appeal to the deep thinkers in the USA to think again about the drift in the state of the nation.\"\n________ The problem is Mr. Fischer and one that you may even be aware of is that our system is corrupt.  It's controlled by special interest groups, and our representatives are in their pockets. These ghetto kids are learning this through the music they all subscribe too, and because we live in a capitalist society we cannot do anything about it.  These kids are growing up in single parent homes under no supervision because the parents in most cases are as ignorant as their children are. I as an American am ashamed of what has happen, the deep thinkers you talk about help create the mess we are in.  As an example these 3 hoodlums will be out of prison in 20 years or less.  They may be sentence to life imprisonment but it is highly unlikely they will serve it. So while this country touts gay rights, medical marijuana and abortion issues the average law abiding American citizen is not even safe in broad day light. My condolence to this young man's family, and as an American I apologize to the nation of Australia. Why make any noise at all.  Nothing will ever change.  If 20 dead babies in Newtown can't stop the madness nothing can.  This country has finally reached the lowest of the low.  Can't wait for Peter T King and Ted Cruz to tell us this is the greatest country in the world...... Sorry Australia for this. We are not all like this! Thoughts and prayers to the family. Hopefully we (USA) will deal with these criminals as they should be, as dogs as they are! It's sad that our country is known for being like this and wish I had a solution. Laws virtually eliminated gun crimes in Australia? Talk about a bald-faced lie. Fact \u2013 homicide rates in the US and Australia declined by very similar amounts over the last 20 years \u2013 30-something percent in both countries. It was NOT gun laws that reduced homicides in Australia, whatever the nutjobs may say. Foreigners: Please stay away! May be that will send a message to the Congress. Otherwise, our Congress is just a bunch of puppets controlled by the thugs at the NRA. Unfortunately, Mr. Young, the problem in America isn't with the \"deep thinkers\".  It's with the shallow ones who buy into the warped patriotic rhetoric of the NRA and their ilk.  Until those groups wake up and realize that they're efforts support gang-bangers and criminals \u2013 not god and country \u2013 we'll continue to have these shootings day in and day out.  There's a great opinion piece in yesterday's NY Times, written by a convicted murderer, about why gun shows and lax laws made it easy for him to get guns, and why the conservative argument against regulation is just a bunch of hot air.  But hey, let's all just keep living in La-La (LaPierre) Land and pretending something else is the problem. self-correction (besides grammar errors), the article I'm referring to was in The Atlantic, not NY Times. The proof is in the pudding. Canadians are healthier and live longer than americans. you canadians have no worries, because the u.s. is right here!!! ask your french and british ancesters about the slaves they brought over here you hippocrits!! why do canadians come down to work and get health-care? Here is the issue nobody wants to address, yet it must be if this problem is ever going to be solved: Black people are violent. They just are. There's no getting around it if you want to be honest. What cities are the most violent? Chicago, Detroit, DC. Majority black population.\nRap music (a big part of black culture) is nothing BUT violence. Mostly black on black violence.\nThey are just violent, plain and simple. THIS is why southern and S. African whites segregated themselves from blacks. Do ppl seriously still watch this show?  What a waste!!  Wish Larry was still around. It's sad and tragic to see a young ambitious gentleman killed by random violence in US. In light of so much of \"US boycott\" calls, I would like to remind that Australia too experiences random killings of South Asian students on their own soil and often times those poor students are told by the local police to avoid passing by certain areas rather than investigating and finding those killers. The anger at the three individuals who carried out the murder, is justified, but it's not right to call on Australians to avoid the entire country. Tim Fischer is in a position of authority and respect, but instead of using that position to provoke thoughtful and rational discussions, he is using it to sow misunderstandings between Americans and Australians, and spread prejudices about, and anger toward the general American population. His statement encouraging Australians to avoid the US, is bigoted. What if we do this, take away all government help, to any one family that is in a gang that kills some one. They don\u2019t seem to care  about going to jail, it\u2019s  a joke to them. So what if there social security, there food stamps, there welfare, was cut off to there families. This would make understand   that they are not just  hurting  the family of the person they killed, but there own family. This would make there family\u2019s, make sure they were not in the gang. Put a little skin in the game, it would change the way they think now wouldn\u2019t it. Does anyone here think the US could become the next South Africa? I think it's somewhat likely. Any insights please? Maybe everyone should look at the staight gun facts.  One fact is more people per 100000 people die in England in stabbing and knife related deaths than people in the US die of guns.  Should England now outlaw knives?  People need to wake up, and you will find that guns are less of a problem than you are being told.   http:\/\/americangunfacts.com\/ I have written a blog about the death of Chris Lane, who could have been my own son\u2013you can find it at\nhttp:\/\/www.portiabpennington.com Thanks for reading, and thanks for discussing the important issues of our day. this is my promise to dr odudu that when my lover is back am going to tell the whole world about the help he did to my life am happy today is the help of dr odudu that bring back my lover back to me,my lover left me because his mum said he should not marry me because she has some one in her mind to to marry her son and i really lover my man so much there is nothing i could do i cry all days and all night for my lover to come back to me but he never come back, when i was browsing on net i saw many people talking about dr odudu how he help and restore their partner back i decided to put in try and all thing went for good immediately i contacted dr odudu on oduduspell@gmail.com the way he speak to me i was feeling good and better when the spell was cast my lover call me the day dr odudu tell his going to come and he really come back will are totally married now.what ever your problem is contact dr odudu is the answer of all via oduduspell@gmail.com or call +2348051913076 what ever your problem is contact this grea man i promise you are going to smile like me.\nwanda from U S A The problem is not gun control, Yes I know we do have a gun problem in this country. It's the lack of respect people have towards others. The right to bear arms law was written back then (when people were smart and actually had respect for others). People had guns back then, and the country wasn't as bad, as it is now. Plus if you get rid of guns then people will just find something else to use. We are living in a society with too many rights. WE have too many rights as a nation. People can basically get away with anything. Especially kids. Kids cannot get punished (because it is viewed as abuse). Abuse and punishment are two different things people. So by not punishing your kids you are teaching them they can do whatever they want to do and they can't get in trouble. We will get so many rights protecting these suspects, and the lawyers will do whatever they can to prove these three were mentally insane and didn't know what they were doing. EXCUSE ME, they knew what they were doing, they did it because they probably knew that all these rights we have will protect them. They kill someone, but yet they will still be alive in prison. Then they will probably just blame their parents, \"Oh we didn't get any love at home, so we did this for attention and because we were bored\". Our laws are messed up in this country. We are the land of the free, but all these rights we have is messing up our country. We have to set limits, bring back the death penalty. Then most likely there will not be as many people killing others, because they know they will get killed themselves if they do. This story really anger's me. This poor guy is just going for a jog and he is shot dead for no reason. Chris I'm so sorry for your loss and it\nwas so sense less. These 3 kids should be beaten death! no other form of justice makes sense.\nIt's not the guns, I bet you all three of these kids have no dad's.

Between the two I would say you have your own genocide going on.\nThis Canadian will be spending travel dollars in more civilized countries. \"U.S runs around the world spouting off\" Gee Jerry. How exactly does a nation of 350 million plus people do that?  I am still waiting for an intelligent debate with a prog  explaining to me why I must give up my rights because politicians refuse to enforce laws? A little naive Jerry; the problem is lack of morals, NOT guns. There is no intelligent debate to be had. If 20 children being shot couldn't change American gun laws , nothing will. Gun companies want to keep people scared and keep the money gravy train going.\nI will just watch from afar as the American tourism dollar plummets. Right on Jerry!\nA fellow Canadian couldn't agree more. Tell me this , why do the vast majority of other first world countries not have these problems?\nI was in Vegas months ago. Day after I left there was a shoot out on the main strip. Like the old American west. Sorry but a bullet proof vest is not usually part of my vacation plans. Canada probably has more guns per capita than the States same as Switzerland .. The difference is the gun LAWS we have.

I'm fully aware that Switzerland is not a Scandinavian country since I have been there.\nPerhaps if schools for all ages of kids was up to par in all neighbourhoods ..

I believe healthcare is a right and not a privilege.. I believe all children deserve a good education and full stomach . If you treat a segment of your society badly they will act badly. Isn't there something in that bible of yours about \" I am my brothers keeper\"? If all the time and effort that is put into religion was put towards actually doing something productive for our fellow human beings the world would be far better off. To each their own.. As long as there is no honor killings and Muslims adhere to canadian law regarding the rights of women.. I really don't care . Every religion has distasteful aspects. Awhile back a Muslim man did honor killings in Ontario , killed his ex wife and three daughters. He is rotting in jail. Absolutely right.  Guns have been part of American culture from the beginning, and yet random shootings of innocents by punks rarely happened.  The correct question to ask is why is this happening now.  If anything, decent people in this country need to arm up, just to defend themselves against the trash that this society is generating. But go on, bleeding-hearts, blame everything but the human garbage that is doing this. The problem isn't decent people not being able to arm up. It's that thugs have easy access to firearms without sensible background checks\u2013which the industy lobbies heavily against. That's where most of our NRA fees go to. You can arm up to the teeth, but it won't prevent a thug from shooting you in the back while running, would it? It won't prevent my kid who is not of legal age to own a firearm\u2013god forbid, from getting involved in another Newtown incident. So, what's the solution? Like it or not, there will always be thugs who will find ways, but having easy access to firearms without any sensible background checks makes it far too easy for them to commit heinous crimes like the one in Duncan. Let's stop making it easy for them. No sir, you do not get it.  It ALL starts with morality.  You are so fixated on guns you don't see the bigger picture.  In Switzerland everyone has a gun and there are less homicides per capita than in Canada.  Hmmmmm those are the FACTS. Jerry, Why do you even care? Go live in your backwards Trailer Park Boys country and leave the heavy lifting to the American grownups...as your failed stupid socialist frogtopia has done for centuries.  Shuttup and LEAVE already if you don't like it , eh?  Go whine to the Saudis about their white slavery trade...oh right ... fear... How many people die standing in line for the super awesome Canadian health care waiting for life saving treatment every year?  Bet the percentages far exceed gun deaths in the US , eh Jerroo? I am in Switzerland.    My guns are in the house but my ammo is at a depot....we cant have it with us in the house. Your argument is based on ignorance, you should try getting over being so ignorant No sir you are changing the argument.  You can get your gun and the ammo and then KILL someone.  Stop trying to change the argument.  If you are telling me that it is impossible for a Swiss citizen to shoot a gun, consider me educated and I will shut up.  Being in Switzerland is not in an of itself a credential.  PS you have gun murders there also but less of them.  Also you are referring to military ammo.  Commercial ammo i understand can still be kept at home. Canadian healthcare?  Looks like you have a few Recycled Conservative Tropes of your own, eh, fella? Well clearly I am a Canadian and so have some experience in this department.  How long have I waited ..... let me count the times.  Let's see 0 x 0, is zero.  Absolutely the biggest GOP BS ever is that a Canadian style healthcare system equals long waiting lines.  YOU betcha will wait for certain non-emergency procedures while the needy folks in front or behind might get into the OR before you.  Folks dying in the hallways and babies having to fly thousands of miles for treatment??? Hyperbole and theatre to make you believe it would be a disaster in the US.  Here is the real honest to Allah truth \u2013 Canada has a universal HEALTHCARE system. The key word there is \"care\".  The US has a system of \"insurance\" \u2013 like car, house, home, fire etc \u2013 it is insurance. uneducated thugs and a plan to turn America into a police state by destroying the economy and by removing the role God once played is your answer for why this happens here. Except that there is no god. Teabaggers worship  Sarah Palin and Dale Earnhardt. Jerry, morals are from God (you may think otherwise). We have problems because our morals keep changing.  Why is Canada's murder rate higher than in Switzerland (which is not a Scandinavian country by the way with all your great gun laws?.  Its because Canadians also have poor morals (and are killing each other without guns) although its probably due somewhat to our influence....72% of Swiss claim to be Christian.  The 2011 Canadian census reported that 67% of Canadians claim adherence to Christianity, followed by no religion at 24%, but rates of religious adherence have been steadily decreasing. Don't worry you are headed where we are, just a little slower.... Yes there are thugs in every country.  And you can get a gun just about anywhere regardless of any gun control laws.  The only way to combat gun violence is through better education, better parenting, and much more severe punishment for gun related crimes. Greg, you are incredibly stupid. Canada's murder rate is higher than switzerland...and so what?   The bottom line here is America....a nation with an incredibly high murder rate, out of control gun giolence and a national sense of paranoia that is crippling. Greg,  Are the morals you get from your god good because he says they are good or are they merely good so he passes them along? It has to be one or the other and both negate your argument. Your logic is messed up.  The country many guns (Switzerland) has a lower murder rate than the country (Canada) with a higher murder rate.  The issue is the morals not the gun.  It is you who are lacking in logic and facts my friend. Circular on your part.  God is the author of morality.  As soon as man determines morality you as a person have no right to suggest what is and is not moral.  Some believe that killing is moral.  I assume you support their right to define their own morality since you don't accept God's. Gregg, \"God is the author of morality.\" You state that as if it's a fact.  I'd like proof of that, which you know that you can't provide.  If that's what you believe, that's just fine, but understand that many people, myself included, think that your statements regarding god and morality are pure, unsubstantiated mysticism. John; i understand your well spoken comments.  In our justice system there are two standards of evidence.  There is the preponderance of evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt.  While I don't think you can include God in the beyond a reasonable doubt category, there is a preponderance of evidence to support his existence.  Please take the time to THOROUGHLY investigate.  Also a point for thought: In the scientific community there is a precept known Occams Razor (you probably know this).  The question for you is which is more likely \u2013 that there is a God that arranged all that we survey or that the mathematically improbable series of coincidences occurred to bring us where we are today?  I think you will find even scientifically that it is far more likely that there is a God.  The only objective then is to find the true God. It has been verified that, by radiometric dating of meteorites, the solar system was formed about 4.5 to 4.6 billion years ago.  Fossil evidence shows that what is generally considered to be life appeared on the planet somewhere between 2.5 and 3.6 billion years ago.   Given that enormous time frame it seems to me to be more likely that, by accident, organic compounds formed, leading to amino acids and phospholipds from which simple, unicellular organisms later evolved.  Over billions of years, the events thought to have given rise to life on Earth do not sound implausible in the slightest.  An invisible man arranging everything sounds much more implausible to me. By the way, my apologies if the \"mysticism\" comment sounded insulting. NP on the mysticism.  The earth may be that old.  We do not know for sure.  The Hebrew word in Genesis for day is yom which can mean many things including eras but it is transcribed as days.  You can however find plenty of sites that question both carbon-14, argon, and strontium dating methods as well.  This does not make the Bible necessarily untrue its just that the framework (and perhaps the translation) may not been well enough understood but there are too many other archaeological, scientific, and historical evidences that the Bible is true.  Also, the mathematics are still against the series of events that you describe (you can look this up) but of course it is possible but certainly not the simplest explanation.  Man wants to exalt himself over creation and the ONLY way he can do that is if he generates a history where he is supreme....... Thanks for insight Jerry.  Hope you do find the Lord Jesus before he returns for he died for our sins.  We do see kids emerge out of bad neighborhoods all the time. The problem is many more listen to and follow Gangsta Rap about killing, raping, get involved in gangs, have no home supervision, and in most cases don't have parents with good morals.  Most are from broken homes.  Many societies fall because of lack of morals.  Glad to hear you are fiscally responsible and conservative as am I, but counsel you friend to limit your liberalism to things God has approved of.... its not that simple Jerry.  You say that they are treated bad.  MOST are not, some are but so are some white people.  The issue I am not sure you are aware of is that many blacks want to act the way they do.  When blacks assimilate they are referred to by other blacks in a disparaging manner.  When blacks, whites, indians, hispanics, etc adapt to the culture around then they have no problem and are not treated any different then anyone else. When they embrace drugs, violence, abuse, etc is when they are treated different.  Canada is just starting to find this out through Muslim extremism but it will grow there also and we will see if your feelings change when your liberal philosophies come face to face with Sharia law....I am sure you would have no problem with Muslims in your country IF they adopted Canadian philosophies; what happens when they wont? Also for what is is worth Jerry you are right about what the Bible says and we do try to live it, we share the gospel and our resources with many.  But although you can lead a horse to water you cannot make him drink.  We are happy to help the helpless but are not happy to help the clueless...In short, if they are trying we help.  If they want to do drugs, commit violence we share the truth with them but will not enable their lifestyle....

    "maintext":"By\n          \n\nNick Greene\n\n \n  It has been two years, nine months, and 10 days since Colin Kaepernick played a professional football game. In that time, the quarterback filed and settled a grievance against the NFL arguing the league blackballed him for kneeling during the national anthem and starting a protest movement against police brutality. While the league and its teams have denied colluding to keep Kaepernick off the field, the facts of his case make it difficult to reach any other conclusion.\n \n  On Thursday, Kaepernick\u2019s representatives offered a helpful reminder of the quarterback\u2019s plight in the form of a punchy explainer.\n Colin Kaepernick\u2019s representatives released statements today to clear up some facts surrounding their client: pic.twitter.com\/Wo86KTkKDM \n  The letter succinctly reiterates what Kaepernick and his representatives have been saying for nearly three years:\n \n  \u2022 \u201cNot a single team has brought Colin in for a workout.\u201d\n \n  \u2022 Kaepernick\u2019s agent has reached out to all 32 teams, but there has been \u201clittle to no response.\u201d\n \n  \u2022 He still wants to play and \u201chas been working out 5 days a week.\u201d\n \n  While there has been a rash of quarterback injuries in 2019, Kaepernick appears no closer to getting an NFL job. The \u201cfootball\u201d argument against signing him is that it has now been too long since he played in the league. (Blackballing will do that to you.) That\u2019s hard to reconcile with Washington\u2019s decision last year to bring in Josh Johnson, who hadn\u2019t thrown a pass in an NFL game since 2011. Johnson didn\u2019t exactly set the league alight during his brief return, but at the very least he demonstrated that he remembered how to play football.\n \n  Kaepernick\u2019s credentials, it\u2019s fair to say, have been analyzed more thoroughly than those of any other out-of-work quarterback in league history, with his defenders and detractors both pointing to his stats to help bolster their arguments. (The detractors have the weaker case, it must be said.) There are about 80 quarterbacks on NFL rosters right now. What would it look like if some of these players were subjected to the same level of scrutiny? Let\u2019s find out.\n \nDoes Josh McCown still want to play football?\n \n  Kind of? He retired at the end of the 2018 season but agreed to join the Eagles after backups Nate Sudfeld and Cody Kessler got hurt. While focusing on his duties as an NFL quarterback, Josh is still committed to his other job as a high school football coach.\n \nWait, what?\n \nJosh agreed to coach at Myers Park High School in Charlotte, North Carolina, after he retired from the NFL in June. According to NJ.com, \u201cMcCown would be allowed to fly to Charlotte [from Philadelphia] on Friday afternoon after practice, time permitting, and make it back in time to continue contributing as a coach for Myers Park on Friday nights.\u201d\n \nHow did Josh do last year for the Jets?\n \n  He threw one touchdown and four interceptions in four games. The Myers Park Mustangs, meanwhile, are currently 6\u20130, so he\u2019s got that going for him.\n \nWhat are Brian\u2019s qualifications as a quarterback?\n \n  Brian served as Tom Brady\u2019s backup in New England last year, so you know he\u2019s good.\n \nHe\u2019s still a backup though, right?\n \n  Yes. He is behind Jacoby Brissett, who was behind Andrew Luck, who is retired.\n \nWhen was the last time he started a game?\n \n  That would be in 2017, when he began the season as the starting quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers.\n \nThat\u2019s interesting, because Colin Kaepernick was the team\u2019s previous starter. He threw for 16 touchdowns and four interceptions in 11 starts for the 49ers. How did Brian do?\n \n  Brian had a low interception rate. Like Colin, he threw only four picks.\n \nHow many touchdown passes did he throw?\n \n  He threw four touchdowns, but it\u2019s hard to get a full picture of his abilities because he started only six games.\n \nWhy did he start only six games?\n \n  San Francisco lost all of them.\n \nWhoa, I remember Matt Schaub. He used to be pretty good, right?\n \n  Indeed. Matt is a two-time Pro Bowler.\n \nWasn\u2019t that a long time ago?\n \n  Only if you consider 2012 a \u201clong time ago.\u201d A child born in 2012 can\u2019t even buy cigarettes yet.\n \nWhat happened in 2013?\n \n  Matt set an NFL record.\n \nWhat record was that?\n \n  He threw a pick 6 in four consecutive games.\n \nWhat\u2019s he done since then?\n \n  You ask too many questions.\n \nNathan Peterman, hmm, why does that sound familiar?\n \n  No reason. It\u2019s a very common name.\n \nSeriously, it rings a bell.\n \n  He\u2019s a promising young quarterback with playoff experience. That\u2019s all you need to know.\n \nOh, wait! Nathan Peterman! From the Bills? The guy who threw five interceptions in one half?\n \n  Not all of them were his fault.\n \nHe\u2019s thrown three touchdown passes and 12 interceptions in his career. Everyone was saying he\u2019s the worst quarterback in history.\n \n  Stats aren\u2019t everything.

    "maintext":"3 Min Read BERLIN (Reuters) - German post and logistics group Deutsche Post DHL (DPWGn.DE) said on Tuesday that it had started to see volumes in China recover from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, and announced a bigger than expected annual dividend.  The company also lifted its target for free cash flow and its shares jumped 6% in early trade, after losing more than a fifth in the last week as the virus spread globally.  \u201cOur immune system is in great shape,\u201d Chief Executive Frank Appel told a conference call with analysts.  DHL\u2019s express volumes have started to recover in China and the company was putting planes back into the network, Finance chief Melanie Kreis said, noting that DHL\u2019s own fleet is a major asset given the grounding of many passenger planes.  Appel said Deutsche Post had not seen a slowdown in Europe yet and it had seen an improvement in its global business in the first week of March, including in Europe.  He said the company, which had released preliminary full year results last month, had decided to increase its dividend for 2020 to 1.25 euros ($1.42) from 1.15 euros last year, ahead of analyst average forecasts for 1.20 euros.  The company raised its forecast for free cash flow from 2020 to 2022 to 5-6 billion euros (\u00a34-5 billion pounds) from a previous 4.5-5.5 billion.  U.S. package delivery companies United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) warned last week the coronavirus outbreak could disrupt shipment of goods in affected countries and possibly weigh on their first-quarter results.  Deutsche Post had already warned last month that it would take a hit from the coronavirus, but Kreis said on Tuesday that the impact on operating profit in February would probably come in at the lower end of a 60-70 million euros range.  The company said it had excluded the impact of the epidemic from its 2020 forecast for operating profit of more than 5 billion euros and reiterated a 2022 target to reach an operating profit of at least 5.3 billion euros.  Deutsche Post said it expects to lose Amazon (AMZN.O) parcel volumes as the U.S. firm ramps up its own logistics operation in Germany, although it hopes to gain share with other customers, with volumes set to grow 0-5% in 2020, after 3.9% in 2019.  For 2019, operating profit rose more than 30% to 4.1 billion euros on sales of 63.3 billion euros, both slightly shy of analysts\u2019 average forecasts.

    "maintext":" The Billion Oyster Project serves students, community and New York Harbor. Be part of the conversation at Pace University (more below). \"How does a city of this magnitude bring young students to the water, and have them feel a sense of ownership and community?\" asks Professor Lauren Birney from her lower Manhattan office at Pace University's School of Education. \"Oysters.\" A century ago, the oyster was New York's pearl. Oystering was as integral to New York Harbor's identity as the Statue of Liberty. The waters of the city and New Jersey boasted more than 260,000 acres of oyster beds spread throughout the harbor, its bays and estuaries, the lower Hudson and East rivers. New Yorkers ate more oyster meat than beef. The original New York \"foot-longs\" were Gowanus oysters, gathered from Gowanus Bay and Creek in Brooklyn and exported to Europe as a delicacy. In present day New York, oysters are better associated with the Oyster Bar in the cellar of New York's Grand Central Terminal, where oysters from Apalachicola Bay in Florida and Chincoteague Bay in Maryland are now the delicacy. Generations of pollution drove out New York oystering, and the name \"Gowanus\" is identified less with the bay and more with the canal, a toxic, Federal Superfund site (hopefully on its way to a major cleanup). But the Billion Oyster Project aims to change all that by enlisting hundreds of thousands of city school children to restore a billion oysters to city waters. \"In short, students are driving the restoration of New York Harbor,\" said Birney. The Billion Oyster Project was the brainchild of the New York Harbor School. Murray Fisher, the school's founder and now president of the New York Harbor Foundation, which helps fund and manage the school's programs, told Grist in 2010, at the project's launch: There are 1.1 million kids in the New York City public school system and the New York Harbor is still one of the richest water habitats in the world. But it's become very degraded and disconnected from those 1.1 million kids.  With\u00a0a $5M grant from the National Science Foundation Birney is co-leading a powerhouse group of collaborators to build upon the Billion Oyster Project and target \"middle-school students in low-income neighborhoods with high populations of English language learners and students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields [Science, Technology, Engineering and Math] and education pathways.\" In addition to the students' hands-on work constructing reefs, growing and planting oysters, maintaining boats and operating monitoring equipment, Birney says the new funding opens up the world of STEM.: The harbor is like a living laboratory for education in STEM. We want to give students the opportunity to learn outside the school building. Our consortium of partners is creating opportunities for citizen science, real-time data collection, operation of monitoring technologies, and more.  After-school mentoring provides extra enrichment for those students especially interested in STEM. Maybe a student gets excited about oysters or the condition of the harbor and decides to be a biologist, or pursue an interest in maritime law. An interest in our monitoring technologies could open a door to the study of engineering. These experiences are such a rarity for our students they may otherwise not have the opportunity to discover their passion. The collaborating organizations are as blue-ribbon a list of partners as one can dream up. Along with Pace University School of Education and the New York Harbor Foundation: New York City Department of Education, Columbia's Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory, New York Academy of Sciences, Good Shepherd Services, University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science,Wildlife Conservation Society's New York Aquarium, and The River Project There is yet another reward to the Billion Oyster Project. Fisher's vision did not end at tying education to oyster restoration. Just as pollution was the enemy of the New York Harbor oyster, the oyster can be the enemy of New York Harbor pollution. One oyster can filter one gallon of water each day, as Fisher explained to The Wall Street Journal this summer: Theoretically, if we have a standing population of one billion oysters, the harbor would be completely filtered every three days. The Billion Oyster Project not only empowers students to build a new future for their community, it enables them to connect their present to their past, while reflecting upon, and redeeming, the unwitting misdeeds of prior generations.  As I discussed this with my Pace colleague Lauren Birney, I was reminded of the teachings of Ernest L. Boyer, the great American educator and adviser to three presidents. He wrote in Hope for Today's Universities: While we are all nonuniform and while we differ dramatically from each other, the simple truth is that all the people on the planet have the marvelous capacity to place themselves in time and space. We can recall the past and anticipate the future. And yet, how often we squander this truly awesome capacity to look in both directions, even neglecting our own roots. A paragraph later comes his most enduring quote -- his simple solution to that intergenerational dilemma, a central tenet of his theory of education taught him by his grandfather who devoted his life to underserved communities: To be truly human, one must serve. Ultimately, the Billion Oyster Project is about service: to the environment, to school children, to a city that lost its environmental way, to those of a long-gone generation who knew not what they were losing, even as it slipped through their fingers. If you would like to be part of this brilliant, groundbreaking effort, join Professor Birney and John Forest Dohlin, director of the New York Aquarium on October 27: ",

    "maintext":"Ever since the premiere of the CBS sitcom \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island\u201d 50 years ago, people have been asking the burning question: Ginger or Mary Ann? While some fans of the broad comedy series about seven archetypal castaways shipwrecked on an \u201cuncharted desert isle\u201d prefer Ginger, the va-va-va-voom actress played by Tina Louise, even more seem to gravitate toward Mary Ann, the cornfed Kansas farm girl with the heart of gold portrayed by Dawn Wells. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see what the 45-year-old man who is now raising children is saying to me,\u201d said Wells, a vital 75, in a recent interview at her comfy Valley Village home. \u201c\u2018You were my fantasy. You were the girl I would take to the prom. You were the girl who understood my problems.\u2019\u201d Rene Reyes, director of public programs and festivals at the Paley Center for Media in Beverly Hills, calls the Ginger-Mary Ann debate a \u201cpop culture battle royale.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s one of those great conversations that\u2019s endured over all of these decades,\u201d he added. Wells\u2019 Facebook page has more than 150,000 fans. More than 20 years ago, she wrote a popular cookbook, \u201cMary Ann\u2019s Gilligan\u2019s Island Cookbook,\u201d and for the 50th anniversary of the series, she\u2019s published a new book she wrote with Steve Stinson, \u201cWhat Would Mary Ann Do? A Guide to Life.\u201d (She\u2019ll be signing copies Monday at Barnes & Noble at the Grove.) \u201cIt\u2019s not my ego talking, but Mary Ann wasn\u2019t just a silly and sweet ingenue,\u201d Wells states in her book. \u201cShe was bright, fair-minded and reasonable, and I like to think that\u2019s what I brought to her. Sherwood Schwartz, the show\u2019s producer and creator, was smart enough to put her in short shorts so you wouldn\u2019t think of her as your bossy sister.\u201d \u201cThat character grounded the show,\u201d said Reyes, noting that Wells had wisely created a Mary Ann brand. \u201cI think it allows people over the years to have grown along with her. It\u2019s getting back to that nostalgic, warm feeling you had watching the show growing up.\u201d But spend any time with Wells and you\u2019ll quickly discover she is Mary Ann \u2014 minus, of course these days, the short shorts, midriff top and pigtails. \u201cMy mother raised me with Mary Ann values and didn\u2019t know she was doing it,\u201d said Wells. \u201cAnd this was in Reno, Nev., where there was gambling and prostitution.\u201d She laments that too many young women these days are trying to emulate the Kardashians instead of channeling their inner Mary Ann. \u201cIn one of my chapters, I write, \u2018Does a $500 purse make you somebody?\u2019\u201d Wells\u2019 parents divorced when she was young. Her father, who was married four times, lived in Las Vegas. \u201cThey shared me,\u201d said Wells, who was Miss Nevada in 1959. \u201cThere was no conflict. I think it\u2019s real hard with today\u2019s families. There are multiple marriages. Most couples have to work. It was very different [when I was growing up]. I was in the Donna Reed era.\u201d The actress attended the all-girls Stephens College in Missouri and the University of Washington in Seattle, where she earned her degree in theater arts. She came to Los Angeles and began working in theater, TV and in such films as 1963\u2019s \u201cPalm Springs Weekend.\u201d Wells speaks with great affection about her three-year \u201ccruise\u201d on \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island.\u201d Bob Denver, who played the bumblingly sweet Gilligan, was a comic \u201cgenius.\u201d Alan Hale Jr., who embodied the teddy bearish Skipper, \u201cwas a wonderful man. I never saw him angry.\u201d She also adored veterans Jim Backus and Natalie Schafer, who portrayed the \u00fcber-rich Thurston and Lovey Howell. \u201cJim Backus was cheap,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cHe would take Natalie and I to lunch and say, \u2018I forgot my wallet.\u2019 I think the first year, Natalie presented him with a bill for $300 and told him, \u2018This is what you owe us.\u2019\u201d Russell Johnson, who played the hunky Professor, wrote the foreword to her book; he died at age 89 in January. Ironically, Wells hasn\u2019t had any contact with Louise in years. \u201cWe had nothing against each other,\u201d said Wells. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have much in common.\u201d Wells admitted that she and other cast members were victims of typecasting after the series ended in 1967. But she\u2019s continued to work, primarily in theater. \u201cThe first thing I did [after \u2018Gilligan\u2019] was \u2018The Owl and the Pussycat,\u2019 where I played a hooker. But it took me two years to get cast in \u2018The Vagina Monologues.\u2019 I think they think of you as a film actor who doesn\u2019t do stage, so they don\u2019t know your range.\u201d Wells is still surprised by the global popularity of \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island,\u201d especially since the sitcom was roundly trounced by critics when it premiered in 1964. Several years ago, she and some of her girlfriends were vacationing in the Solomon Islands when they canoed to an island where there was no running water, electricity or television. Even on that remote island in the Pacific, Wells was recognized. \u201cThe chief\u2019s wife said, \u2018I know you. In 1979, I was going to nursing school in Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands, and I used to come home and watch you in black-and-white!\u2019\u201d susan.king@latimes.com Twitter: @mymackie Get the Indie Focus newsletter, Mark Olsen's weekly guide to the world of cinema.

    "maintext":" \u00a9 2020 NBCNEWS.COM With help from a big telescope and a little detective work, astronomers have discovered 20 new moons in orbit around Saturn. The discoveries, announced Monday by the International Astronomical Union, bring to 82 the total number of natural satellites known to be circling the sixth planet from the sun. A gas giant that's the second-largest planet in our solar system, Saturn now has more known moons than any other planet. Jupiter, the largest planet and the previous record holder, has 79 known moons. \u201cIt was fun to find that Saturn is the true moon king for our solar system,\u201d Scott Sheppard, a faculty member at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C., and the leader of the team of astronomers who discovered the moons, told NBC News MACH in an email. He called the moons \u201cremnants of the objects that helped form the planets.\" Sheppard is credited with last year's discovery of 12 previously unknown moons around Jupiter, a haul that brought that planet to its 79-moon total. The institution held a contest to name five of those Jovian moons and is holding a similar contest to name all 20 of Saturn's newfound moons. Entries must be submitted via Twitter by Dec. 6. This site is protected by recaptcha\u00a0Privacy Policy\u00a0|\u00a0Terms of Service Saturn's newfound moons are believed to have arisen after the formation of the planets billions of years ago was mostly complete. Each has a diameter of about 5 kilometers, or 3 miles. Seventeen are in so-called retrograde orbits, meaning their movement is opposite to Saturn\u2019s rotation around its axis. Three are in prograde orbits, meaning they move in the same direction as the planet\u2019s rotation. The research caused a buzz in the astronomy world. \u201cI\u2019m super-excited that it\u2019s come out,\u201d said Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. The discoveries add to the \u201cforensic evidence\u201d relating to the formation of Saturn and the solar system overall, she added. \u201cWe\u2019ve been to Saturn. Cassini was there, Voyager was there, and we still missed these moons,\u201d Faherty said, referring to NASA space probes that visited Saturn. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that in astronomy, you can fly right by and right around and still miss things.\u201d Sheppard\u2019s team discovered the moons by taking a fresh look at observations made more than a decade ago using the Subaru Telescope, an 8.2-meter telescope located atop Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii. \u201cI went back through the old data searching by eye for very faint things our automatic program may have missed,\u201d Sheppard said in the email, adding that it was \u201ca very time-intensive process.\u201d More Saturnian moons may yet be found. Sheppard said about 100 moons with a diameter of at least one mile are believed to be orbiting the planet \u2014 but it will take bigger telescopes to find these tiny bodies, whose small size and extreme distance makes them very hard to observe.

    "maintext":" Facebook is suing several law firms that represented a man who claimed he owned half of the social network and was entitled to billions of dollars from the company and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The case was dismissed in April and the man, Paul Ceglia, is facing related criminal charges. Facebook Inc. and Zuckerberg filed a lawsuit Monday against DLA Piper and other law firms and lawyers, saying they conspired to file and prosecute a fraudulent lawsuit. Ceglia claimed in a 2010 lawsuit that he and Zuckerberg signed a 2003 software development contract that included a provision entitling him to half-ownership of Facebook in exchange for $1,000 in startup money for the budding company. Facebook's lawyers had claimed that while the two did have a contract, references to the company were slipped in for the lawsuit. In its lawsuit filed in New York State Supreme Court, Facebook claims that the lawyers representing Ceglia \"knew or should have known\" that his lawsuit was fraudulent and \"based on an implausible story and obviously forged documents.\" Facebook is seeking unspecified damages along with reimbursement of its expenses racked up in defending itself against the lawsuit.   DLA Piper called the suit \"baseless.\" Peter Pantaleo, DLA Piper's general counsel, in a statement said Facebook sued \"to intimidate lawyers\" to refrain from suing the Menlo Park, California-based company. The other defendants did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment. I always get a warm and fuzzy feeling when lawyers get sued for being unethical jerks. http:\/\/t.co\/V17oKwKhSh via @KurtWagner8 #Hornell attorney Paul Argentieri and anyone else who represented Paul Ceglia of #Wellsville is being sued by @facebook #FacebookOwnership \u00a9\u00a02020 NBC UNIVERSAL",

    "maintext":"\nJohn Plunkett \n\nTue 27 Apr 2010 05.35\u00a0EDT\n\n\nFirst published on Tue 27 Apr 2010 05.35\u00a0EDT\n\n David Cameron has described himself as the \"most pro-BBC Conservative leader there's ever been\" but said the corporation needs to cut back and \"focus on what matters most\". The Tory leader, who has previously said he may cut the cost of the BBC licence fee, said he would \"never do anything to put the BBC at risk\". \"I'm probably the most pro-BBC Conservative leader there's ever been!\" he told the Radio Times in its new issue published today. \"I worked at ITV for seven years [as director of corporate affairs at Carlton] and you learn to respect the incredibly important role the BBC plays,\" he said. \"Competitors like the BBC because you're competing up here on quality rather than down here on price. I would never do anything to put the BBC at risk. Conservatives should be as proud of establishing the BBC as Labour are of establishing the NHS.\" Asked about the fate of BBC 6 Music, the digital radio station which BBC director general Mark Thompson is planning to axe, along with its sister digital station the Asian Network, Cameron said: \"I think it's up to the BBC.\" \"They were trying to do too many things and they're right to focus on doing good things well. There was a moment the BBC had overreached on magazines, websites, [buying] Lonely Planet [travel guides],\" he added. \"I think they do need to retrench a bit and focus on what matters most. So while I might like listening to Radio 6 because it's my sort of music, you can't do everything.\" Cameron has previously been highly critical of the corporation, saying it had \"lost touch with the values of the people who support it through the licence fee\". He has said the Conservatives would freeze the licence fee and may cut if in future years if they came into power. The Conservatives have also said they would publish the salaries of all the highest earners at both the BBC and Channel 4 as part of plans to name all public sector workers on a salary of more than \u00a3150,000. Cameron's comments were published two days after more than 40 actors and performers, including Eddie Izzard, Catherine Tate and Terry Jones, signed a public letter denouncing plans to cut the licence fee, accusing opposition politicians of a \"cavalier attitude towards the BBC's independence\". Cameron said he was a fan of the BBC News website. \"I use the BBC [News] website a lot,\" he told the listings magazine. \"Before PMQs [Prime Minister's Questions] sometimes I think, 'I might be interested in X, but what's really going on?' The BBC site is a very good way of seeing what are the five most important things going on. \"The political sites are getting good: The Spectator's Coffee House blog, Iain Dale, Guido, Nick Robinson's blog. I'm a great fan of iTunes. Most of my internet use is fairly functional, shopping and travel. I'd have to be really bored to surf around YouTube watching random Dog Eats Ice Cream clips.\" He remains to be convinced by social networking sites such as Twitter, however. \"I'm not on Facebook, I don't tweet. Social media, I don't really get. Politically I know it's a great opportunity; personally, I don't want to be 'poked' or whatever it is.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

    "maintext":"The job market remains rocky in parts of the U.S., and many consumers are reluctant to spend lavishly after some lean years. For many Americans, this year's tax refund will go to paying down bills or be deposited into savings, where it will stay until a rainy day. But a decent tax refund can be more than a quick fix to household finances. If you plan to retire with some degree of comfort, it's crucial to put your savings to work if you can, and build a decent nest egg. Keep in mind that if you get a modest 5% rate of return each year, $2,500 today turns into almost $8,500 in 25 years, more than tripling your savings. If you find a way to invest an additional $2,500 every year, you'll be sitting on more than $133,000 in 25 years. TAX TIPS:Get the latest tax news and advice WAITING FOR YOUR REFUND?:IRS is slowly catching up That's the power of compound interest over time: You make a little bit of money on your investment, then reinvest those returns, which can grow your savings substantially over the long haul. If you can't find a way to scrape together the cash, a tax refund is a great chance to get the ball rolling. A check of $1,000 or more from the IRS can provide a great springboard to retirement savings. Here are a few long-term investing ideas to try to generate a decent return on that 2012 tax refund. Divert it to your 401(k) Technically, you can't deposit money into a 401(k) that doesn't come through your employer. But there is a work-around if you talk to your benefits co-ordinator. Use your tax refund for living expenses, as you would a paycheck, and have the same sum shunted directly into your 401(k) plan. Here's an example: You take home roughly $1,200 a month after taxes and health insurance. Your tax refund is for $2,400. For two months, you will live off your tax refund while your regular paycheck is diverted to your 401(k). After two months, everything goes back to normal. MONEY QUICK TIPS:Use your 401(k) to maximize retirement savings If you have the discipline to make this work, it's a great savings tool. It's a little more paperwork, but benefits managers might be happy to work this out with you. Buy low-cost funds in an IRA If you don't have a 401(k), starting a similar program on your own via an IRA is easy, and it comes with a tax deduction worth up to $5,000. An IRA, or individual retirement account, gives you access to a broader range of investments. That may sound intimidating, but don't fret; the simplest options are often the best for long-term investors. Those options include low-cost index funds that mirror a broad-based benchmark such as the S&P 500 Index. You'll have built-in diversification for stability without managing a complicated portfolio. One place to start might be an S&P 500 ETF, which spreads your money across the components of the S&P 500, some of the biggest corporations in America, such as Walmart, Google and Ford. Such funds are a good value, too costing as little as $1 a year for every $2,000 you've invested. YOUR MONEY:Best ways to cash your tax refund If you're intimidated, why mess around with researching lots of other investments when you can hold a piece of 500 different stocks for a dollar a year? It takes out the guesswork and protects you, because if one stock crashes, you still have 499 others that can offset any losses. With the IRA tax break and easy access to diversification, low-cost funds are a great option, even for investors with only a small amount of money to invest. Invest in yourself One option many people overlook is the notion of investing in themselves. This tax refund may be your opportunity to do that. If you have a knack for writing, a few hundred bucks can build you a website. If you're handy, buy some tools and take out a few classified ads. If you're a shutterbug, buy some top-notch gear and build a portfolio that might get you into the wedding photography business. The downside is that your plans may never pan out. But there's risk in everything, from the stock market to entrepreneurship. Wouldn't you rather lose your money on your dream business than on Wall Street? The upside is that the ceiling is limitless. Your initial investment may pay for itself quickly, and the satisfaction of being your own boss and living out your dreams may be beyond any dollar amount. Saving for your retirement is wise. But making a living doing what you love may mean you never have to truly retire at all.
